It produces Hoftracs, wheel loaders, telescopic wheel loaders and telehandlers, which are preferably used on farmland for feeding, scattering, fertilising, loading and stacking. The company has sites in Diemelsee- Flechtdorf and Korbach, and is part of the Wacker Neuson group.  History  Maschinenfabrik Weidemann KG was founded in 1960 in Diemelsee-Flechtdorf (Hesse, Germany). From 1960 to 1972, the company focused on production of farmyard equipment and dung removal equipment. In 1972, Weidemann invented the Hoftrac farm crane. This small, articulated machine was specifically designed for narrow and low farmyard buildings. In 1979, the company was renamed as Weidemann GmbH & Co. KG. Weidemann continued to expand over the next few years. In the early 1990s, the first foreign affiliate was established in the Netherlands and operations commenced at plant III in Gotha (Thuringia, Germany). In 2005, the company then known as Wacker Construction Equipment AG (now Wacker Neuson SE) acquired Weidemann. This involved a further expansion of production capacity. The production plant in Korbach was completed in 2007. Since then, Weidemann GmbH has been a wholly owned affiliate of Wacker Neuson SE. Weidemann machines are sold in over 30 countries worldwide by in-house organisations in close cooperation with specialist dealers.

She was named by Governor Mark Sanford as the sixth South Carolina Poet Laureate in 2003. Biography Early life and education Wentworth was born Marjory Heath on June 3, 1958, in Lynn, Massachusetts, and raised in nearby Swampscott. Her parents were John and Mary (Tully) Heath. As a child, she spent many years in and out of hospitals to correct some congenital organ anomalies. Adding further hardship was the fact that her father, John, a purchasing agent for Parker Brothers, died of leukemia when she was just 14 years old. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College (where she majored in anthropology, political science, and dance) and went on to receive her M.A. in Writing from New York University (NYU). While at NYU, she studied under Galway Kinnell, Phil Levine, Joseph Brodsky, and Carolyn Forch√©. After Mount Holyoke, she did some studies at Oxford University. Career While still a graduate student at New York University, Wentworth worked in refugee resettlement with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees. She went on after graduating to work as a book publicist with Readers International, a branch of Amnesty International, interviewing with Brodsky for the job. After moving to South Carolina with her husband in 1989, Wentworth began teaching both children and adults in the area. In 1993, she started teaching as an adjunct instructor at Trident Technical College in North Charleston, South Carolina. For many years she has conducted the \\"Expressions of Healing\\" class at Roper Hospital in Charleston. The class focuses on those affected by cancer. She also teaches at the Charleston County School of the Arts and the creative writing class at The Art Institute of Charleston. She is also president of the Lowcountry Initiative for the Literary Arts. Wentworth and her husband Peter run Wentworth PR which manages public relations for publishers and authors such as Dottie Frank, Mary Alice Monroe, and Gary Smith. Poet laureateship Wentworth read the inaugural poem at Mark Sanford's first inauguration as Governor of South Carolina. Shortly thereafter, in 2003, he appointed her as the sixth South Carolina Poet Laureate. Usually given a small honorarium ($1,200) as poet laureate, this honorarium was cut by Sanford in 2003 when Wentworth agreed to serve without the pay. As poet laureate, Wentworth is on the board of directors of The Poetry Society of South Carolina. Personal life She is married to filmmaker Peter Wentworth and they have three sons. They were introduced by her brother, Jack, and were married soon after graduating from college, on June 27, 1981. The Wentworth family moved to Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, and lived there for many years, beginning in 1989. Shortly after relocating, though, Hurricane Hugo hit the area hard and they were unable to live in their house for nearly a year. It was during that time that their third child was born. Later, the family moved to nearby Mount Pleasant in 2004. Wentworth is a close friend of former South Carolina first lady Jenny Sanford.

The Twist is designed for business users and runs Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system. Features Design The ThinkPad Twist in tablet mode The Twist is built to Intel's Ultrabook specification. Its look and feel are consistent with other ThinkPad devices. The Twist has a flat smooth cover with a soft rubbery finish and a flourish of silver-colored material around the edge. The outer case has both Lenovo and ThinkPad logos. Notably, the dot in the ThinkPad logo's \\"i\\" pulses when the unit is powered on. The Twist weights 3.5 pounds and is .8 inches thick. While not backlit, the Twist's island-style keyboard is spill-resistant and has U-shaped chiclet-style keys in order to enhance user comfort. The ThinkPad Twist in action Specifications and performance The Twist has 12.5-inch multitouch display made with Gorilla Glass. Like the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga, its display, with a resolution of 1366 by 768 pixels, is connected to the base of the machine by a sturdy hinge capable of rotating 180 degrees in every direction. The display has brightness of 350 nits. This hinge, along with Windows 8, allows the Twist to serve as both a laptop and a tablet. A lock button at the bottom of the screen allows users to override the built-in accelerometer. The Twist does not have a discrete graphics processor; its display is powered by Intel's HD 4000 integrated graphics processor. The Twist is available with a choice of three different Intel processors, up to 8GB of RAM, a choice of 7200RPM hard drives in 320GB and 500GB capacities or a much faster 128GB solid-state drive. An mSATA slot containing a 24GB SSD is used as cache for fast startup. The Twist also has two USB 3.0 ports, a mini-HDMI output, a mini DisplayPort, an Ethernet jack, a 3.5mm audio output, and a memory card reader. In a test conducted by Engadget the Twist's 43 watt-hour battery was able to support four hours and 18 minutes of video playback with Wi-Fi on and the display set at 65-percent brightness. Lenovo claims a similar battery life. Pre-installed software includes Evernote, Amazon's Kindle reader, Skype, AccuWeather, eBay, the streaming service rara.com, Microsoft Office, a trial of Norton Internet Security, Lenovo Support, and Lenovo Solutions for Small Business. Lenovo's proprietary support software includes a backup and restore utility, a USB blocker, software monitoring, power management tools, tune-up utilities, and Lenovo Cloud Storage, powered by SugarSync. Lenovo offers a free download of QuickLaunch, a utility that restores Windows' traditional Start Menu in order to avoid the new interface of Windows 8. Reception In a review for Gadling Gear Kraig Becker wrote,\\"If you're in the market for a new laptop and you're looking to harness the full potential of Windows 8, the Lenovo Twist is a fantastic choice. I found that once I started using a touch screen notebook it was incredibly difficult to go back to a standard model. Touch just seems like a natural way to interact with our devices now and anything less seems archaic in comparison. Aside from sub-par battery life, I found the Twist to be a great laptop for the average traveler's needs, providing the ability to communicate with friends and family, while staying productive on the road. It's lightweight and thin body make it highly portable and the touch screen simply makes it fun to use. When was the last time you could say that about your laptop?\\" In a review for TechRadar James Stables gave the device 4/5 stars and wrote, \\"The Lenovo ThinkPad Twist is well designed, sturdy and a strong performer. It'll also last you a good while, racking up over three and a half hours of battery use under moderate conditions. It's just as happy acting as a powerful tablet as it is a laptop, and while a little heavier than normal laptops, the versatility on offer makes it a machine worth considering if you're looking for a serious workhorse.\\" In a review for Engadget Dana Wollman wrote, \\"Lately, we feel like all of our reviews of Windows 8 convertibles end the same way. The ThinkPad Twist has plenty going for it: a bright IPS display, a good port selection, an affordable price and an unrivaled typing experience. Like ThinkPads past, it also offers some useful software features for businesses lacking dedicated IT departments. All good things, but what's a road warrior to do when the battery barely lasts four hours? Something tells us the Twist will still appeal to Lenovo loyalists, folks who trust ThinkPad's build quality and wouldn't be caught dead using any other keyboard. If you're more brand-agnostic, though, there are other Windows 8 convertibles with comfortable keyboards -- not to mention, sharper screens, faster performance and longer battery life.\\" A review published by the Financial Mail states, \\"The bang-up-to-date five-point multitouch screen measures 12.5 inches, with an HD resolution of 1366 x 768, topped with Gorilla Glass ‚Äî protective and pretty. The screen looks great from all angles. My only complaint is the lost space: it has quite a thick bezel, and could have been that much more impressive with an edge-to-edge display.\\" References External links Category:Lenovo laptops Category:Tablet computers Category:Convertible laptops Category:2-in-1 PCs Twist ","title":"ThinkPad Twist"},{"id":"37983739","text":"Canarium microurceus is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Strombidae, the true conchs. Description Distribution Phylogeny In 2006, Latiolais and colleagues proposed a cladogram (a tree of descent) that attempts to show the phylogenetic relationships of 34 species within the family Strombidae. The authors analysed 31 species in the genus Strombus including Canarium microurceus (referred to as Strombus microurceus in their analysis), and three species in the allied genus Lambis. The cladogram was based on DNA sequences of both nuclear histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) protein-coding gene regions. In this proposed phylogeny, Strombus labiatus (= Canarium labiatum) and Strombus microurceus are closely related and appear to share a common ancestor.

(2002) Personal Property Law (Clarendon Law Series) , Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 1 History The division of property into real and personal represents the division into immovable and movable incidentally recognized in Roman law and generally adopted since. \\"Things personal,\\" according to Blackstone, \\"are goods, money, and all other movables which may attend the owner's person wherever he thinks proper to go\\" (Comm. ii. 16). This identification of things personal with movables does not express the English law, owing to the anomalous position of chattels real. In England, real property is supposed to be superior in dignity to personal property, which was originally of little importance from a legal point of view. This view is the result of feudal ideas, and had no place in the Roman system, in which immovables and movables were dealt with as far as possible in the same manner, and descended according to the same rules. Types Personal estate is divided in English law into chattels real and chattels personal; the latter are again divided into choses in possession and choses in action. Interest in personal property may be either absolute or qualified. The latter case is illustrated by animals ferae naturae, in which property is only coextensive with detention. Personal property may be acquired by occupancy (including the accessio, commixtio, and confusio of Roman law), by invention, as patent and copyright, or by transfer, either by the act of the law (as in bankruptcy, judgment and intestacy), or by the act of the party (as in gift, contract and will). There are several cases in which, by statute or otherwise, property is taken out of the class of real or personal to which it seems naturally to belong. By the operation of the equitable doctrine of conversion money directed to be employed in the purchase of land, or land directed to be turned into money, is in general regarded as that species of property into which it is directed to be converted. An example of property prima facie real which is treated as personal is an estate pur autre vie, which, since 14 Geo. II. c. 20, s. 9,1740-1741(now replaced by the Wills Act 1837, s. 6) is distributable as personal property in the absence of a special occupant. Examples of property prima facie personal which is treated as real are fixtures, heirlooms, such as deeds and family portraits, and shares in some of the older companies, as the New River Company, which are real estate by statute. In ordinary cases shares in companies are personal property, unless the shareholders have individually some interest in the land as land. Comparison to real property The main differences between real and personal property which still exist in England are these. *(1) In real property there can be nothing more than limited ownership; there can be no estate properly so called in personal property, and it may be held in complete ownership. There is nothing corresponding to an estate-tail in personal property; words which in real property would create an estate-tail will give an absolute interest in personalty. A life-interest may, however, be given in personalty, except in articles quae ipso usu consumuntur. Limitations of personal property, equally with those of real property, fall within the rule against perpetuities. *(2) Personal property is not subject to various incidents of real property, such as rent, dower or escheat. *(3) On the death of the owner intestate real property descends to the heir; personal property is divided according to the Statute of Distributions. *(4) Real property as a general rule must be transferred by deed; personal property does not need so solemn a mode of transfer. *(5) Contracts relating to real property must be in writing by the Statute of Frauds, 29 Car. II. c. 3, s. 4; contracts relating to personal property need only be in writing when it is expressly so provided by statute, as, for instance, in the cases falling under s. 17 of the Statute of Frauds. *(6) A will of lands need not be proved, but a will of personalty or of personal and real property together must be proved in order to give a title to those claiming under it. *(7) Devises of real estate fall as a rule within the Mortmain Acts (see Charity And Charities; Corporation); bequests of personal property, other than chattels real, are not within the act. (8) Mortgages of real property need not generally be registered; mortgages of personal property for the most part require registration under the Bills of Sale Acts (see Pledge, and Bill Of Sale). Comparison to Scots law The terms heritable and movable of Scots law to a great extent correspond with the real and personal of English law. The main points of difference are these. *(1) Leases are heritable as to the succession to the lessee, unless the destination expressly exclude heirs, but are movable as to the fisk. *(2) Money due on mortgages and securities on land is personalty in England. At common law in Scotland debts secured on heritable property are themselves heritable. But by the Titles to Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1868, s. 117, heritable securities are movable as far as regards the succession of the creditor, unless executors are expressly excluded. They still, however, remain heritable quoad fiscum, as between husband and wife, in computing legitim, and as far as regards the succession of the debtor. *(3) Up to 1868 the heir of heritage succeeded to certain movable goods called heirship movables, which bore a strong likeness to the heirlooms of English law. This right of the heir was abolished by the act of 1868, s. 160. *(4) Annuities, as having tractum futuri temporis, are heritable, and an obligation to pay them falls upon the heir of the deceased.Watson, Law Diet. s.v. \\" Annuities\\" Comparison to US The law in the United States agrees in most respects with that of England. Heirlooms are unknown, one reason being, no doubt, that the importance of title-deeds is much less than it is in England, owing to the operation of the Registration Acts. Long terms in some states have annexed to them the properties of freehold estates. In some states, estates pur autre vie descend like real property; in others an estate pur autre vie is deemed a freehold only during the life of the grantee; after his death it becomes a chattel real. In yet other states, the heir has a scintilla of interest as special occupant.Kent, Comm. iv. 27 In some states, railway rolling stock is considered as purely personal; in others, it has been held to be a fixture, and so to partake of the nature of real property. Shares in some of the early American corporations were, like New River shares in England, made real estate by statute, as in the case of the Cape Sable Company in Maryland.Schouler, Law of Personal Property, i. In Louisiana, animals employed in husbandry are, and slaves were, regarded as immovables. Pews in churches are generally real property, but in some states they are made personal property by statute. The assignment of choses in action is generally permitted, and is in most states regulated by statute. U. W.) Cases *Carrier's Case (1473) 13 Edw. IV, f. 9, pl. 5 (Star Ch. and Exch.

Four million trips daily are made using ATAC services, transporting 1,148,966,529 passengers in 2009.ATAC S.p.A.  Azienda per la mobilit√†  Public transport in Rome before 1909  The first form of public transportation in Rome, which opened in 1845, was horse-drawn omnibus from Montanara to St. Paul. When Italy was united, there was a growing demand for public transportation services, so many private companies were created, all doing different, unrelated things. In 1876, an agreement was made between the City of Rome and the Roman Omnibus Society to create more horse-drawn buggies. In those same years, streetcars began to develop. The first line was from piazza del Popolo to Milvian Bridge. In the next few years, many other streetcars began to develop, and by 1895, there were five lines. In 1900, the SRTO opened 10 Omnibus lines, four animal- drawn trams and 11 electric trams.  History  Established in 1909 as AATM (Autonomous Municipal Tramway), led by Ernesto Nathan, the company changed its name almost immediately to ATM (Municipal Tramways Company) and inaugurated the Commercial Service on March 21, 1911, with the line III Piazza Colonna - Holy Cross in Jerusalem (ATM lines are numbered with Roman numerals to distinguish them from SRTO lines, which then ran most of the urban tram network). In 1919, ATM began to gradually absorb SRTO's lines and rolling stock, becoming the dominant transit company in Rome. In 1926, the Governorate of Rome, which replaced the City, was established. Consequently, ATM changed its name to ATG, and two years later, with the establishment of the first bus lines, the ATG became ATAG (Bus and Tramways Company of the governorate). On December 21, 1929, the SRTO closed down as it only ran a single line. All of its fleet was trasnfered to the ATAG, which implemented a radical reform of the network by removing all the tram lines within the city center and replacing them with buses from 1 January 1930. After the reform the network was structured on a series of radial lines which originated from a circular internal loop and were interconnected by a circular outer loop. On 8 January 1937, the first two trolleybuses, 137 and 138, came into service in the Flaminio district. On August 9, 1944, the city returned to its original status, so the ATAG became ATAC. It started to tackle the difficult task of rebuilding the network and the fleet. For the first two years of the post-war period a minimum service was provided by ‚Äútrucks,\\" and then in February 1947, ATAC restored the first 6 lines. The return to the pre-war network was not achieved until 1948. In the 1950s, the highway network in Italy expanded, which caused train ridership to decrease. In July 1972, the last trolleybus line (47) was closed. In 2000, ATAC underwent further transformation: it has only retained ownership of the facilities, tram and trolleybus and deposits, while selling the task of managing the business to external concessionaires. The management of most of the lines of Rome is assigned to the Tramway, which is wholly owned by the City of Rome. Some private companies have won the public tender for the management of other local lines, mostly peripheral ones.

He is a two-time medalist at the World Junior Rowing Championships, and also a member of the Oxford Blue. Rowing career Kusurin started out his sporting career as a basketball player, until he encouraged by his friends to try out for rowing at the age of fourteen. He won two medals for the double sculls at the World Junior Rowing Championships, and also, attained multiple top-ten finishes at the World Under-23 Regatta and at the World Rowing Cup series. Realizing that he needed funding and a full-time career, Kusurin applied for a full scholarship and took up a business degree in finance at the University of Washington in Seattle. While attending college, he discovered competitive rowing and power training, and suddenly became a full-fledged member of the Washington Huskies Rowing Club. He also served as the captain of the rowing team, and captured numerous gold medals for his collegiate crew at the Pac-10 Rowing Championships, the Windermere Cup, and the San Diego Crew Classic. Although he played for the Washington Huskies during his collegiate career, Kusurin continued to row in his national senior squad annually. After graduating from the University of Washington in 2007, Kusurin attended the University of Oxford Sa√Ød Business School, where he became a member of the Oxford University Boat Club. He participated twice in The Boat Race, in 2007 and 2009, along with top-class rowers including Great Britain's Colin Smith and New Zealand's George Bridgewater, an Olympic bronze medalist in the coxless pair. Olympics Kusurin represented Croatia the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where he and his partner Mario Vekiƒá competed for the men's double sculls. The pair directly qualified for the semi-final A/B rounds, after finishing second in the heats, with a time of 6:27.38. Shortly before the rowing competition, Kusurin and Vekic were involved in a bus accident, which killed three Chinese nationals and injured several Australian delegates and their coach Dragutin Milinkovic. While their coach was rushed to a nearby hospital around Beijing, the pair went off to the competition and rowed strongly for a fourth-place finish in the semi-final round, with a fastest possible time of 6:24.89. Few hours later, Kusurin and Vekic missed out of the final B round, and automatically finished in twelfth overall position. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Rowing Federation (FISA) had also rejected an appeal sent by the Croatian Olympic Committee (HOO) to include the pair as a seventh scull in the final race.

The Soviet military command suspects hostile intent from Germany and so arranges for its spies to infiltrate ranks of the German military and the SS. Alexander Belov (Lyubshin) is a Russian spy, who travels from Soviet-held Latvia to Nazi Germany under an alias of Volksdeutsche Johann Weiss. His mastery of the German language, steel nerves and an ability to manipulate others help him to use his connections in the SS to ascend the ladder of the Abwehr and then in the SD. He uses his position to identify sympathetic Germans, who help him to procure vital intelligence, and to help local resistance movements in their collective fight against Nazism.

An earlier name Mukti Fauj was also used. On 7 March 1971 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman issued a call to the people of East Pakistan to prepare themselves for an all- out struggle. Later that evening resistance demonstrations began, and the military began a full-scale retaliation with Operation Searchlight, which continued through May 1971. A formal military leadership of the resistance was created in April 1971 under the Provisional Government of Bangladesh. The military council was headed by General M. A. G. OsmaniUnconventional Warfare in South Asia: Shadow Warriors and Counterinsurgency, Gates and Roy, Routledge, 2016 and eleven sector commanders.The Colonel Who Would Not Repent: The Bangladesh War and Its Unquiet Legacy, Salil Tripathi, Yale University Press, 2016, pg 146. The Bangladesh Armed Forces were established on 4 April 1971. In addition to regular units, such as the East Bengal Regiment and the East Pakistan Rifles, the Mukti Bahini also consisted of the civilian Gonobahini (People's Force).South Asian Crisis: India ‚Äî Pakistan ‚Äî Bangla Desh, Robert Jackson, Springer, 1972, pgs. 33, 133 The most prominent divisions of the Mukti Bahini were the Z Force led by Major Ziaur Rahman, the K Force led by Major Khaled Mosharraf and the S Force led by Major K M Shafiullah. Awami League student leaders formed militia units, including the Mujib Bahini, the Kader Bahini and Hemayet Bahini. The Communist Party of Bangladesh, led by Comrade Moni Singh, and activists from the National Awami Party also operated several guerrilla battalions.Communist and Marxist parties of the world, Charles Hobday, Longman, 1986, pg. 228 Using guerrilla warfare tactics, the Mukti Bahini secured control over large parts of the Bengali countryside. It conducted successful \\"ambush and sabotage\\" campaigns, and included the nascent Bangladesh Air Force and the Bangladesh Navy. The Mukti Bahini received training and weapons from India, where people in West Bengal shared a common Bengali ethnic and linguistic heritage with East Pakistan. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Mukti Bahini became part of the Bangladesh-India Allied Forces. It was instrumental in securing the Surrender of Pakistan and the liberation of Dacca and other cities in December 1971. Organization The \\"Mukti Bahini\\" was divided into two groups; the \\"Niomito Bahini\\" or \\"regular forces\\" who came from the paramilitary, military and police forces of East Pakistan, and the Gonnobahini or \\"people's forces\\" who were civilians. These names were given and defined by the Government of Bangladesh. The Indians referred to the Niomito Bahini as \\"Mukti Fauj\\", and the Gonnobahini were called \\"freedom fighters\\". Background Flag of Bangladesh in 1971, used during the Bangladesh Liberation War. East Pakistan campaigned against the usage of Urdu as the sole official language of Pakistan. The Awami League had won the majority in the 1970 Pakistan election. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, as the leader of the Awami League, was prevented from forming a government. Bengali was the only language in Pakistan not written in the Persian-Arabic script. The administrative change that merged the administrative provinces of West Pakistan into one \\"unit\\" caused great suspicion in East Pakistan. Pakistan's unwillingness to give autonomy to East Bengal and Bengali nationalism are both cited as reasons for the separation. The 1970 Bhola Cyclone had caused the death of 500,000 people while the infrastructure, transport and other services were severely damaged. The central government of Pakistan was blamed for the slow response and misuse of funds. It created resentment in the population of East Pakistan. The resentment allowed Awami League to win 160 of the 162 parliamentary seats allocated to East Pakistan which made Awami League the majority party in the 300 seat parliament of Pakistan. After 1971 elections, Yahya Khan hoped for a power sharing agreement between Mujib and Bhutto, though talks between them did not result in a solution. Mujib wanted full autonomy, Bhutto advised Yahya to break off talks. In March, General Yahya Khan suspended the National Assembly of Pakistan. On 7 March 1971, Sheikh Mujib made his now famous speech in Ramna Race course (Suhrawardy Udyan) where he declared \\"The struggle this time is for our freedom. The struggle this time is for our independence\\". East Pakistan television broadcasters started broadcasting Rabindranath songs, a taboo in Pakistan, while reducing the air-time of shows from West Pakistan. Civilian interaction with the Pakistan Army were decreased and they were increasingly seen as an occupying force, while local contractors stopped providing supplies to the Pakistan Army. The Pakistan Army also tried to disarm and dismiss personnel of Bengali origin in the East Pakistan Rifles, the police and the regular army. The Bengali officers mutinied against the Pakistan Army, and attacked officers from West Pakistan. The Pakistan Army's crackdown on the civilian population had contributed to the revolt of East Pakistani soldiers. The East Pakistani soldiers moved to India and formed the main body of Mukti Bahini. Sheikh Mujib on 26 March 1971 declared the independence of Bangladesh, while Pakistan's president Yahya Khan declared Mujib a traitor during a national broadcast on the same day. The Pakistan Army moved infantry and armoured units to East Pakistan in preparation for the coming conflicts. Early resistance Location of West Pakistani (marked ) and rebel Bangladeshi (marked ) military units in March 1971. On 25 March, martial law was declared, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested and Operation Searchlight started in East Pakistan. Foreign journalists were expelled and the Awami League was banned. Members of the Awami league, the East Pakistan Rifles, the East Bengal Regiment and others thought to be disloyal to Pakistan were attacked by the Pakistan army. The survivors of the attack would form the backbone of the Mukti Bahini. When the Pakistan Army started the military crackdown on the Bengali population, they did not expect prolonged resistance.Pakistan Defence Journal, 1977, Vol 2, p2-3 Five battalions of the East Bengal Regiment mutinied and initiated the war for liberation of Bangladesh. On 27 March, Major Ziaur Rahman declared Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan and fought his way out of Chittagong City with his unit of Bengali soldiers. The East Pakistan Rifles and the East Pakistan Police suffered heavy casualties while challenging the Pakistan Army in Dhaka, where West Pakistani forces began the 1971 Bangladesh genocide with the massacre at Dhaka University. Civilians took control of arms depots in various cities and began resisting Pakistani forces with the acquired weapons supply. Chittagong experienced heavy fighting between rebel Bengali military units and Pakistani forces. The Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence was broadcast from Kalurghat Radio Station in Chittagong by Major Rahman on behalf of Sheikh Rahman. Bengali forces took control of numerous districts in the initial months of the war, including Brahmanbaria, Faridpur, Barisal, Mymensingh, Comilla and Kushtia among others. With the support of the local population, many towns remained under the control of Bengali forces until April and May 1971. Notable engagements during this period included the Battle of Kamalpur, the Battle of Daruin and the Battle of Rangamati-Mahalchari waterway in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. On 18 April, the Deputy High Commission of Pakistan in Kolkata defected and hoisted the flag of Bangladesh. On 17 April, the Mujibnagar Government was formed. During May, Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto asked General Yahya Khan to hand over power in West Pakistan to his party. Khan refused on the grounds that doing so would support the view of Mukti Bahini and the Provisional Government of Bangladesh that East Pakistan was a colony of West Pakistan. Tensions were raised when Bhutto told his followers that \\"by November [he] would either be in power or in jail\\". On 9 June, Mukti Bahini members hijacked a car and launched a grenade attack on Dhaka Intercontinental Hotel, the office of the Pro-Junta Morning Post and the house of Golam Azam. July‚ÄìNovember July Italian howitzers used by the Mujib Battery; now preserved at the Bangladesh Military Museum. The Mukti Bahini divided the war zone into eleven sectors. The war strategy included a huge guerrilla force operating inside Bangladesh that targeted Pakistani installations through raids, ambushes and sabotaging West Pakistani-controlled shipping ports, power plants, industries, railways and warehouses. The wide dispersion of West Pakistani forces allowed Bengali guerrillas to target smaller groups of enemy soldiers. Groups ranging in size from five to ten guerrillas were assigned specific missions. Bridges, culverts, fuel depots and ships were destroyed to decrease the mobility of the Pakistan Army. However, the Mukti Bahini failed in its Monsoon Offensive after Pakistani reinforcements successfully countered Bengali engagements. Attacks on border outposts in Sylhet, Comilla and Mymensingh had limited success. The training period slowed the momentum of the Bangladesh Forces, which began to pick up after August. After the monsoon, the Mukti Bahini became more effective while the Indian army created a number of bases inside East Pakistan for the Mukti Bahini. The railways in East Pakistan were almost completely shut down due to the Mukti Bahini's sabotage. The provincial capital, Dhaka, had become a ghost town with gun-fire and explosions heard throughout the day. August After a visit to East Pakistan refugee camps in India in August 1971, US Senator Ted Kennedy believed that Pakistan was committing a genocide. Golam Azam called for Pakistan to attack India and to annexe Assam in retaliation for India providing help to the Mukti Bahini. Azam accused India of shelling East Pakistani border areas on a daily basis. Oxfam predicted the deaths of over one hundred thousand children in refugee camps and that more could die from food shortages in East Pakistan because of the conflict. September Regular Mukti Bahini battalions were formed in September 1971, increasing the effectiveness of the Mukti Bahini. Sabotage and ambush missions continued to be carried out, demoralising the Pakistan army. October In October, conventional Bangladesh Forces mounted various successful offensives, capturing 90 of the 300 border outposts. The Mukti Bahini intensified guerrilla attacks inside Bangladesh while Pakistan increased reprisals on Bengali civilians, though the movement of Mukti Bahini into, out of, and inside East Pakistan became easier and more common. November In November, Indian involvement increased, with the Indian artillery and Indian Air force providing direct cover for the Mukti Bahini in some offensives. Attacks on infrastructure and the increase in the reach of the provisional government weakened the control of the Pakistan government. Air operations The Bangladesh Air Force (BAF) was established on 28 September 1971 under the command of Air Commodore A. K. Khandker. It initially operated from a jungle airstrip near Dimapur in Nagaland, India. When taking over liberated territories, the Bangladesh Forces gained control of World War II airstrips in Lalmonirhat, Shalutikar, Sylhet and Comilla in November and December. The BAF launched \\"Kilo Flights\\" under the command of Squadron Leader Sultan Mahmud on 3 December 1971. Sorties by Otter DHC-3 aircraft destroyed Pakistani fuel supplies in Narayanganj and Chittagong where targets included the Burmah Oil Refinery, numerous ships and oil depots. Naval operations The Bangladesh naval forces took shape in July. Operation Jackpot was launched by the Bangladesh Forces on 15 August 1971. Bangladesh Navy commandos sank vessels of the Pakistan Navy in Mongla, Chittagong, Chandpur and Narayanganj. The operation was a major propaganda success for Bangladeshi forces, as it exposed to the international community the fragile hold of the West Pakistani occupation. The Bangladesh Navy commandos targeted patrol craft and ships carrying ammunition and commodities. With Indian aid, the Mukti Bahini acquired two vessels, the Padma and Palash, which were retrofitted into gunboats with mine-laying capabilities. The boat crews extensively mined the Passur River in the Sundarbans, reducing the ability of Pakistani forces to operate from the Port of Mongla but were mistakenly bombed by Indian Air Force troops that resulted in the loss of both vessels and some of the lives of the Mukti Bahini and Indian personnel on board. The developing Bangladesh Navy carried out attacks on ships and used sea mines to prevent supply ships from docking in East Pakistani ports. Frogmen were deployed to damage and sabotage ships. Organization Mukti Bahini propaganda posters, one referencing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's 7 March speech and calling all Bengali Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and Hindus to unite as one nation. M. A. G. Osmani, a Bengali veteran of the British Raj forces in World War II and the Pakistan army, established the Bangladesh Armed Forces on 4 April 1971. The Provisional Government of Bangladesh placed all Bangladeshi forces under the command of Osmani, who was appointed as the defence minister with the rank of Commander- in-Chief as a four star general. Osmani designated the composition of the Mukti Bahini into several divisions. It included the regular armed forces which covered the Army, Navy and Air Forces; as well as special brigades including the Z Force. Paramilitary forces, including the East Pakistan Rifles and police, were designated as the Niyomito Bahini (Regular Forces). They were divided between forward battalions and sector troops. Another civilian force was raised and known as the Gonobahini (People's Forces) consisting of lightly trained civilian brigades under military command; the Gonobahini also consisted of battalions created by political activists from the pro-Western Awami League, the pro-Chinese and socialist National Awami Party, led by Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani, and the pro-Soviet Communist Party of East Pakistan. The guerrilla movement was composed of three wings: well-armed Action Groups which took part in frontal attacks; military intelligence units; and guerrilla bases. The first conference of sector commanders was held during July 1971, starting on 11 July and ending 17 July. Prominent sector commanders included defector officers and soldiers from the Pakistan Armed Forces, including Major Ziaur Rahman, Major Khaled Mosharraf, Major K M Shafiullah, Captain A. N. M. Nuruzzaman, Major Chitta Ranjan Dutta, Wing Commander M Khademul Bashar, Major Nazmul Huq, Major Quazi Nuruzzaman, Major Abu Osman Chowdhury, Major Abul Manzoor, Major M. A. Jalil, Major Abu Taher and Squadron Leader M. Hamidullah Khan.List of Liberation War Sectors and Sector Commanders of Bangladesh (Gazette Notification No.8/25/D-1/72-1378), Ministry of Defence, Government of Bangladesh, 15 December 1973 The Mujib Bahini was led by Awami League youth leaders Sheikh Fazlul Huq Moni, Tofael Ahmed and Abdur Razzak. An Australian war veteran, William A. S. Ouderland, organised guerrilla warfare in Dacca and provided vital intelligence to the Bangladesh Forces. He was awarded the Bir Protik for his actions by the government of Bangladesh. Left- wing politicians Kader Siddique, Hemayet Uddin and Moni Singh created several guerrilla units. Kader Siddique operated in the Tangail District. Hemayet was a former soldier in East Pakistan and his Bahini was raised almost entirely on local supplies. Moni Singh was a communist leader in East Pakistan. The Independent Bangladesh Radio Station was one of the cultural wings of the Mukti Bahini. The Bangladesh liberation movement released five prominent propaganda posters which promoted the independence struggle irrespective of religious affiliations and gender. One of the posters famously portrayed Pakistan's military ruler, Yahya Khan, as a demon. The Mukti Bahini operated field hospitals, wireless stations, training camps and prisons. Equipment The Mukti Bahini benefited from the early control of Pakistani arms depots, which were overtaken by Bengali forces during March and April 1971. The Mukti Bahini purchased large quantities of military-grade equipment through the arms market in Calcutta, including Italian howitzers, Alouette III helicopters, \\"Dakota\\" DC-3 aircraft and \\"Otter\\" DHC-3 fighter planes. The Mukti Bahini also received a limited supply of equipment from the Indian military, as New Delhi allowed the Bangladeshi forces to operate an independent weapons supply through Calcutta Port. The Mukti Bahini used Sten Guns, Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles and Indian-made hand grenades. See: Bangladesh-India Allied Forces Pakistan's Lt. Gen. A. A. K. Niazi signing the Pakistani Instrument of Surrender in Dhaka on 16 December 1971, in the presence of India's Lt. Gen. Aurora. Standing behind them are various officers from India's Army, Navy and Air Force. The launch of Operation Chengiz Khan by West Pakistan on North India finally drew India into the Bangladesh conflict and a joint command structure was established between the Bangladeshi and Indian forces. Three corps of the Indian Armed Forces were supported by three brigades of the Mukti Bahini and the Bengali guerrilla army. The Mukti Bahini and its supporters guided the Indian army and provided them with information about Pakistani troop movements. The Indian and Mukti Bahini greatly outnumbered the three Pakistani army divisions of East Pakistan. The Battle of Sylhet, the Battle of Garibpur, the Battle of Boyra, the Battle of Hilli and the Battle of Kushtia were major joint engagements for the Bangladeshi and Indian forces, who swiftly captured surrounding land by selectively engaging or bypassing heavily defended strongholds. For example, the Meghna Heli Bridge airlifted Bangladeshi and Indian forces from Brahmanbaria to Narsingdi over Pakistani defences in Ashuganj. The cities of Jessore, Mymensingh, Sylhet, Kushtia, Noakhali and Maulvi Bazar quickly fell to the Mukti Bahini-Indian joint forces. In Dhaka, the Pakistan Army and its supporting militias began the mass murder of Bengali intellectuals and professionals in a final attempt to eliminate the Bengali intelligentsia. Historian Yasmin Saikia writes that the Mukti-Bahini, Indian forces, the Pakistani Army, and pro-Pakistani militias looted, raped, and killed civilians in East Pakistan. The Mukti Bahini liberated most of the Dhaka District by mid-December. In Western Pakistan, Indian forces advanced deep into Pakistani territory as the Port of Karachi was subjected to a naval blockade by the Indian Navy. Pakistani generals surrendered to the Mukti Bahini-Indian forces in Dhaka on 16 December 1971. Relations with India Ten million Bengali refugees fled into neighbouring India because of famine and ravages of the Pakistan army, where the regions of West Bengal, Tripura and the Barak Valley shared strong ethnic, linguistic and cultural links with East Pakistan. The war sparked an unprecedented level of unity in the Bengali- speaking world. There was strong support for Bengalis and Mukti Bahini from the Indian media and public. India feared that if the movement for Bangladesh came to be dominated by communists then it would adversely affect its own fight with the left-wing Naxalites. It also did not want the millions of refugees to be permanently stranded in India. Indian Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, authorised diplomatic, economic and military support to the Bangladesh Forces in April 1971. The Provisional Government of Bangladesh established its secretariat in exile in Calcutta. The Indian Armed Forces provided substantial training and the use of its bases for the Bangladesh Forces. The Bangladesh liberation guerrillas operated training camps in the Indian states of Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Tripura and West Bengal. Mukti Bahini were allowed by India to cross the border at will. Some Mukti Bahini, especially those who served in the security services of Pakistan, were suspicious of Indian involvement and wished to minimise its role. They also resented the formation of the Mujib Bahini by India which was composed of Sheikh Mujib-loyalists but was not under the command of Mukti Bahini or the provisional government of Bangladesh. On 6 December 1971, India officially recognised Bangladesh as an independent country only hours after Bhutan did the same. International reactions The genocide by Pakistani forces caused widespread international outrage against West Pakistan. In the United States, Democratic senator Ted Kennedy led a chorus of strong domestic criticism against the Nixon administration for ignoring the genocide of Bengalis in East Pakistan. The Mukti Bahini enjoyed significant international public support. The Bangladeshi provisional government considered setting up an \\"International Brigade\\" with European and North American students. French Minister of Cultural Affairs Andr√© Malraux vowed to fight on the battlefield alongside the Bangladesh Forces. The Soviet Union threw its weight behind the Bangladesh Forces and India after being convinced of Pakistan's unwillingness for a political solution. Separately, US efforts to woo China through Pakistan led to India signing a friendship treaty with Moscow in August 1971. India increased support to Mukti Bahini after the signing of the treaty. For India, the treaty was an important insurance policy against a possible Chinese intervention on the side of Pakistan. China had fought a brief war with India in 1962. Both the US and China, however, ultimately failed to mobilise adequate support for Pakistan. Honours Bir Sreshtho (The Most Valiant Hero) is the highest military honour in Bangladesh and was awarded to seven Mukti Bahini fighters. They were Ruhul Amin, Mohiuddin Jahangir, Mostafa Kamal, Hamidur Rahman, Munshi Abdur Rouf, Nur Mohammad Sheikh and Matiur Rahman. The other three gallantry awards in decreasing order of importance are Bir Uttom, Bir Bikrom and Bir Protik.The Bangladesh Gazette, 15 December 1973. Women Women had served in the Mukti Bahini during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The Mukti Bahini trained several female battalions for guerrilla warfare. Taramon Bibi is one of the two female wars heroes of the Bangladesh Liberation War. Captain Sitara Begum is noted for setting up field hospitals for injured Mukti Bahini fighters. Professor Nazma Shaheen, University of Dhaka, and her sister were female members in the Mukti Bahini. Post-war Aparajeyo Bangla (Invincible Bengal) was finished on 16 December 1978 by Syed Abdullah Khalid at University of Dhaka Campus, is a Monument to Mukti Bahini. The Mukti Bahini was succeeded by the Bangladesh Armed Forces, the Bangladesh Rifles and the Bangladesh Police. Civilian fighters were provided with numerous privileges, including reservations in government jobs and universities. The Bangladesh Freedom Fighters Assembly was formed to represent former guerrillas. Bangladesh Liberation War ministry is responsible for looking after the welfare of Mukti Bahini members. The widespread availability of arms created serious law and order concerns for the Bangladesh government after the war. A few militia units are alleged to have taken part in reprisal attacks against the Urdu-speaking population following the Pakistani surrender. Indemnity On 28 February 1973 the government of Bangladesh enacted the National Liberation Struggle (Indemnity) Order to provide indemnity \\"to those persons in respect of acts done in connection with the national liberation struggle, the maintenance or restoration of order\\" which was to be enforced retrospectively from 26 March 1972. Criticism After the Liberation War of Bangladesh ended, many people who had been denied repatriation to Pakistan were forcefully relocated to refugee camps, were referred to as Stranded Pakistanis and denied citizenship of Bangladesh. Cultural legacy The National Martyrs' Memorial in Bangladesh The Mukti Bahini has been the subject of numerous artwork, literature, films and television productions.

The village is located in the Haspengouw region, and was a separate municipality until its merger into Tongeren in 1977. History The village was mentioned as Riuti in 1065. The area had been inhabited since prehistory, and two tumuli and several Roman villas have been discovered. In 1408, the Battle of Oth√©e between the Prince- Bishop of Li√®ge and the citizens of Li√®ge, took place near the village. After the conquest of Maastricht in 1632 by the Dutch Republic, Rutten was one of the redemptiedorpen (redemptive villages) who remained independent by paying taxes to both the Dutch Republic and the Duchy of Brabant. In 1785, the village officially became part of the Netherlands by the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1843, the right bank of the Meuse became Belgian Limburg by the Treaty of Maastricht, and from then on Rutten was a Belgian village. In 1977, the municipality of Rutten merged into Tongeren. Sights The Holy CottageThe Hamal Castle is located near Rutten, and was home to the lord of the village. The castle was first mentioned in 1214. The current castle dates from the late 18th century. The Holy Cottage (Dutch: Heilig Huisje) is located on a hill near Rutten with a view on the village and the Basilica of Tongeren. It is a chapel dedicated to the Battle of Oth√©e, and dates back to the 15th century. The current chapel dates from the 18th century. Rutten's townscape is protected by the Flemish regional government. Events On 1 May the Saint Evermarus Festivities are held.

It is based on the idea that when prices of different goods change at different rates, consumers will adjust their purchasing patterns by purchasing more of products whose relative prices have declined. This reduces the cost of living. The \\"fixed weight\\" CPI also takes such substitutions into account, but does so through a periodic adjustment of the \\"basket of goods\\" that it represents, rather than through a continuous adjustment in that basket. Application of the chained CPI to federal benefits has been controversially proposed to reduce the federal deficit.  Background  Currently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics computes each month average prices of 211 different categories of goods and services in 38 different urban geographical areas, totaling 8,018 different elementary indices. From these, higher-level indices are obtained as weighted averages of these elementary indices, using different weights for different categories of goods and services nationwide or for different groups of consumers. One set of weights is used to obtain a consumer price index (CPI) for all urban consumers (CPI-U). Another is used to compute a CPI for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W). The weights for CPI-U and CPI-W are currently updated in January of every even-numbered year to correct for \\"substitution bias\\", the idea that consumers will change their buying patterns to keep their cost of living from rising as quickly as inflation. To understand \\"substitution bias\\", consider for example the price of Granny Smith apples. If the price of those apples increases faster than the price of Red Delicious apples, or if the price of Granny Smith declines more slowly than the price of Red Delicious apples, consumers may decide to purchase more Red Delicious apples; this \\"lower-level\\" substitution bias is accounted for in the current CPI-U and CPI-W. However, if the price of apples increases faster than that of oranges, or if the price of apples declines more slowly than the price of oranges, consumers on average will respond by purchasing fewer apples and more oranges. This changes the \\"market basket\\" of goods they buy; this \\"upper-level\\" substitution is not accounted for in the traditional CPI until the next adjustment which could be up to two years later, but impacts the Chained CPI (C-CPI-U) the next month.  Impact on benefits  Various public and private organizations use CPI data for Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs) for programs like Social Security and for provisions of the tax code. Currently most programs are indexed to the CPI-U or the CPI-W. Changes in consumer prices are used to determine issues such as Cost of Living Adjustments, so any reduction in the official estimate of inflation would reduce payments to workers and retirees. If the official adjustment is greater than the inflation experienced by the recipients of the adjustment, they get an unearned benefit; if it's less than the real inflation, they are penalized‚Äîand the expense to those paying wages or retirement benefits are impacted in a complementary fashion. Beyond this, various thresholds in the tax code are also indexed to a CPI: If these thresholds grow more slowly, tax receipts would likely increase. Application of chained CPI has been suggested as a means of reducing the US federal budget deficit by reducing the rate of growth of government benefits. The Moment of Truth Project estimates that moving to the Chained CPI would reduce the deficit by about $390 billion in the first decade alone, with roughly one third of the savings from Social Security, another third from increased federal revenue (via inflation-indexed tax provisions such as more slowly growing tax bracket thresholds), and the remaining savings from a combination of other spending programs and reduced interest on the debt. The Congressional Budget Office estimates switching to the chained CPI would save $340 billion Applying the chained CPI beginning in 2015 instead of 2014 and accompanying it with \\"low income protections\\" would save $230 billion  History of proposals and controversy  In 1996, the Advisory Committee to Study the Consumer Price Index (the Boskin Commission) estimated that in 1996 CPI-W (used to adjust Social Security) over-estimated inflation 1.1 percent. The BLS responded by making changes to the CPI-U and CPI-W, which included an adjustment to compensate for upper-level substitution bias, performed each January of an even-numbered year. In 2002 BLS created the Chained CPI (C-CPI-U) that provides more frequent monthly adjustment for substitution bias. Proponents of the chained CPI include the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Heritage Foundation. It is also included in the recommendations of various bipartisan commissions designed to reduce the deficit such as Simpson-Bowles, Domenici-Rivlin, and the Gang of Six. In 2012 and 2013 as part of the fiscal cliff negotiations, President Obama repeatedly proposed the application of chained CPI to social security benefits as a way to address budgetary shortfalls. This position was controversial with many, including Democrats and Social Security advocacy groups. Some oppose the measure for the reason that changing inflation metrics to the Chained CPI would inappropriately cut the growth in benefits under programs like Social Security and Supplemental Security Income. Opponents include the AARP the American Federation of Government Employees, the AFL-CIO and Social Security Works. They claim that the current CPI used for the elderly understates the inflation seniors experience, primarily because the elderly purchase more medical care than younger people, and medical care inflation has exceeded inflation in the rest of the economy. The Congressional Budget Office said in 1998 that the CPI metric used for cost of living adjustments \\"grows faster than the cost of living\\". According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, ‚Äúmoving to the Chained CPI would address this by using a superlative [chained] index that updates expenditure weights and formulas in order to address consumer response to substitutions between categories.‚Äù Since 2000 the Chained CPI has on average measured inflation between 0.25 and 0.3 percentage points lower than CPI-U and CPI-W. Opponents of the change note that while the difference is small, it compounds over time, making the reduction in outlays for COLAs for Social Security larger when looked at over a long time horizon. Opponents also claim that using CPI-W to adjust retirement benefits like Social Security does not properly estimate inflation for seniors, because the elderly have consumption patterns different from urban wage earners and clerical workers (studied for CPI-W). For example, the elderly consume roughly double the medical care of all urban consumers (studied for CPI-U and C-CPI-U) and urban wage earners and clerical workers (for CPI-W); inflation in medical care has exceeded that in much of the rest of the economy. To adjust for this, the BLS computes a consumer price index for the elderly (CPI-E). However, the CPI-E as an index has a number of flaws. For one, it covers a very small sample size and is in reality just a subset of the CPI-U rather than its own index. More importantly, there is substantial controversy about whether the CPI appropriately measures health care cost inflation ‚Äì a problem which is particularly pronounced in the CPI-E. As CBO explains, it is unclear ‚Äúwhether the cost of living actually grows at a faster rate for the elderly than for younger people‚Ä¶ Some research suggests that BLS underestimates the rate of improvement in the quality of health care and that such improvement may be reducing the true price of health care by more than 1 percent a year. If that is the case, then all versions of the CPI overstate growth in the cost of living, with the overstatement especially large for the CPI-E.\\" Chained CPI has moreover been criticized for its disproportionate impact on women who live longer, but typically have less savings than men. Concerns have also been raised regarding the impact of chained CPI on veterans, and persons with disabilities. The argument is that because veterans and the disabled collect benefits before retirement age, they would stand to lose a more significant share of income from Social Security and other programs over time. Furthermore, Chained CPI has been depicted as a regressive piece of social policy, as persons earning between $30,000 and $40,000 will be disproportionately impacted by the lowering of the inflation adjustment for income.  Distribution effect  thumb thumb Moving to the chained CPI would reduce Social Security benefits by 3% for the bottom 60% of Social Security recipients and 4% for the top 40% of beneficiaries (per estimates for 2050 from the Social Security Administration ). The Tax Policy Center estimated that changing the Chained CPI would increase the taxes paid by 30% of the bottom 20% of the income distribution, 70% of the next 20% of the population, and nearly all of the people in the top 60% of the income distribution.

Built as a joint venture between India's Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Oman's Oman Oil Company, the 6 million tonnes per year refinery was commissioned in May 2011. The capacity of the refinery was further enhanced to 7.8 million tonnes per year in 2018.  History  Bharat Oman Refineries Limited was first conceived in the early 1990s as the Central India refinery. Work on the refinery at Bina however began only in 2006. The project, initially conceived as an equal partnership between BPCL and the Oman Oil Company, however faced significant delays on account of environmental clearances and poor infrastructure and suffered from severe cost overruns that saw its cost of establishment increasing from a budgeted 6,300 crore to 91 billion. Following these delays and cost overruns, the Omani company initially dropped out of the project but subsequently decided to be a minority stake holder in the project holding 26% equity. The refinery which was to have been commissioned in 2009 was finally inaugurated in May 2011 by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. One percent of the plant's equity is held by the Government of Madhya Pradesh. The refinery is expected to create 5,000 jobs for Local peoples of district who comes to its criteria after then state so that they boost tax revenues for the state government.  Capacity  The BORL refinery has a current installed capacity of processing 7.8 million tonnes of crude oil per annum (MTPA) or 156,000 barrels per day. The refinery also consists of a naphtha hydrotreater, a catalytic reformer to produce gasoline, a hydrocracker, a diesel hydrotreater and a delayed coker. The capacity at the refinery is to be augmented to 7.8 MTPA and is to reach a final capacity of 15 MTPA by 2022‚Äì23. Refinery has consistently delivered environmentally compliant products since its inception, qualities of some of the products are better than the upcoming BS VI specifications envisaged through Auto Fuel Policy. BORL is a future ready refinery and the debottlenecking project will further strengthen refinery configuration to deliver premium quality fuel in line with stringent norms of the country. Exports of naphtha from the refinery began in 2012. The plant is equipped to produce Euro III and Euro IV petroleum products and is capable of producing Euro V petroleum products with minimal additional investment.  Pipelines  The Bina refinery uses a single point mooring system at Vadinar in Gujarat to facilitate the unloading of imported crude oil from large crude carriers. The crude is transported through a 935-km long pipeline from Vadinar to Bina. The products of the refinery are then transported through the 257- km Bina-Kota pipeline where it joins the Mumbai-Manmad-Bijwasan pipeline to reach the markets of North India.

The church dates from the 12th century and was built in the Romanesque style. In accordance with a local tradition, it is painted red. It is best known for its frescos, said to be Denmark's oldest.Jens Kinkel, \\"Eskilstrup Kirke\\", Danmarks Kirker. Retrieved 20 December 2012. History At the beginning of the 16th century, the church was owned by the bishopric under the administration of its seat at S√∏rup on Lolland. In 1694, it was annexed to √ònslev Church, 3 km to the west. After the Reformation it came under the Crown until 1767 when it was sold into private ownership. It was, however, soon reacquired by the State until 1852 when it was sold to the farmers of the parish. It gained full independence in 1933., Kirsten Weber- Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud K√∏bke Knudsen, \\"Eskilstrup Kirke\\", Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8, 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 1297‚Äì1308. Retrieved 20 December 2012. Architecture The church consists of a Late Romanesque apse, chancel and nave and a Gothic tower and porch, all built of brick. Pilaster strips decorate the corners of the nave and chancel. The apse and chancel have a rounded foundation base. There is a three-sided wall at the east end of the apse while there are round-arched windows in the side walls. The toothed cornice is decorated a saw-toothed trimming which runs along pilasters to the chancel gabel. The nave walls are similarly decorated with cornices and pilasters. The chancel windows resemble those of the apse but they have been extended downwards. Interior and fittings The apse's original vaulting develops from a polygonal base to a quarter dome terminating in the rounded apse arch. During the Gothic period, the chancel ceiling was cross-vaulted while the chancel arch was widened and given a pointed top. The nave has retained a flat ceiling. The red brick tower on a fieldstone base has flat arched windows to the south and west. It opens into the nave through a large irregular arch. The Renaissance altarpiece (1617) is rather a rough piece of rural craftmanship. The large cornice is borne by two Ionic columns. The central painting by Stefan Viggo Pedersen (1926) depicts the announcement of Jesus' birth to the shepherds. Designed by J√∏rgen Ringnis, the intricately carved pulpit (1639) is in the Auricular style. With the four Evangelists in shell-framed panels, it closely resembles the pulpit in Lolland's Ryde Church. The pilasters have however been renewed during rebuilding work in 1805 although the cherub heads and ornamental decorations have been retained. The hexagonal canopy bears a dove at the top and angels' heads on the corners. The pulpit, staircase and canope are varnished but not coloured. Frescos In 1893, frescos were discovered in the apse and chancel, dating to the second half of the 13th century. The chancel fresco, restored by E. Lind in 1942, includes scenes from Christ's childhood including the Flight to Egypt depicting Joseph, Mary and the ass. They are said to be among the oldest in the region.\\"Eskilstrup Sogn\\", Folkekirken i Lolland-Falsters Stift. Retrieved 20 December 2012.

(Or BFF) is an Indian teen drama which aired on Channel V India from December 3, 2012, to May 25, 2013. The show ran for a total of 140 episodes and is loosely based on the American show Pretty Little Liars. Plot Ela receives a delivery at Sanju's house. She is shocked to see the clutch she had lost on the night of Varun's disappearance in the delivery box. She finds a message in the clutch and shows it to Vinnie. They suspect Daljeet is behind the blackmail. Ela screams upon seeing Varun in the mock court. Ela runs out of the mock trial room after seeing Varun there again. She believes that he is alive. Vinnie tells her that it might be a ghost and reminds her of Varun's death. The scene begins when Varun jumps off a mountain on Valentine's night. Vinnie and Ela go in search of him. Varun hangs onto Ela's clutch to climb up the mountain, but they fail to save him. Daljeet talks to someone about his ploy against the girls. In class, Sanju, Ela, and Vinnie panic when Professor Anu claims that someone provoked Varun to commit suicide. Ela suspects a connection between Professor Anu and Varun, but Sanju disregards her suspicion. Varun and his sister, Professor Anu, discuss their ploy against the best friends for not saving Varun from the cliff and planting false evidence to mislead the police. Sanju and Ela become scared when there is a power outage at home. Vinnie and the boys surprise them with a party at Sanju's house. Varun sneaks into the washroom and scares Ela. Varun approaches Ela in the dark and confronts her for pushing him off the cliff. Ela and Vinnie argue. Ela receives a taunting message from Varun when everyone plays truth or dare, threatening to reveal the truth to Sanju if she does not confess how she had cheated in the exams. Sanju becomes upset upon learning that Ela had topped the exams by switching the answer papers with her. She tells Vinnie that she can never trust Ela again. She denies forgiving her. Professor Rigved expels Ela for cheating. Varun calls Ela. Vinnie attends the call. He uses a voice changing software to speak to her. He tells Vinnie that he has kept evidence of their crime in Sanju's locker. Ela and Vinnie worry that Sanju will go to the police if she sees the proof. Vinnie goes to the locker room to get the evidence before Sanju sees it. Prithvi tells Sanju that she is the central piece holding their group together. He persuades her to join the gang in the canteen. They understand Sanju's situation and care for her. Sanju asks them not to affect their friendship with Ela because of what happened. Meanwhile, Vinnie and Ela panic when they see sketches of them standing on the cliff on Valentine's night in the envelope. Varun blackmails them and gives them 2 hours to get Rs. 10 lakh. Ela and Vinnie meet the mystery guy, who is Varun, at an isolated location. He records their confession of his murder by tricking them. Varun asks for more money, asks them to once again meet him on the same cliff. Vinnie steals money from her mother's locker. Varun tries to kill them on the cliff when Sanju enters the scene while searching for Ela and Vinnie. She has seen their video message confessing to her. Sanju defends her best friends and says to Varun that he is still the bad guy. If he wants to kill them, he should kill her first. Varun hesitates and says he never wanted to kill them. Rather, he just wanted Ela and Vinnie to know how it feels to come near death. He then walks away. The BFF's are happy and head back to Sanju's home. Now, Varun is back in Westwood. Ela and Vinnie are planning Sanju's surprise birthday party. Sanju realizes that she is in love with Prithvi. All of Sanju's friends, as well as her small brother Sunny, also ignore Sanju. They choose Prithvi to bring Sanju to the party. Varun knows that the BFFs are planning something for Sanju's birthday. Varun calls Sanju and asks her to come with him for dinner and celebrate her birthday. Sanju tells Varun that if he comes to her house, she will call the police. As she cuts the call, somebody rings the bell of her house. Sanju thinks it to be Varun and takes a jug full of water as she opens the door. She, not able to distinguish the person, pours the jug forward onto the person revealed to be Prithvi. Prithvi comes inside the house and asks Sanju for her shirt to get it ironed. Prithvi asks Sanju to come with him for a pizza. Sanju goes to her room and gets ready to go. Prithvi takes her to a place which is dark. Sanju, being afraid, was going to leave the place but was stopped by the unexpected arrival of her friends. Somebody is now stalking Sanju and trying to hurt Prithvi. In the meantime, Vinnie's mother finds a boy to get Vinnie engaged. Vinnie's mother tells the name of the boy: Purushashtra. As Vinnie does not want to get engaged, Ela plans how to let that boy go. They invite the boy in a cafe where Ela pretends to be Vinnie. She pretends that Vinnie is an independent girl who has many boyfriends. However, Purushashtra (nicknamed Puru) identifies the real Vineeta Maheshwari. He slyly reminds them that he is also capable of using the internet, telling her the real name of each of her friends. The trustees of the Westwood College arrange a party for Holi for the students. The stalker comes to the party and applies color to Sanju. Prithvi follows the stalker and cuts his hand, but the stalker runs away. Prithvi leaves on the day of the Holi party. Mac also finally breaks up with Ela on the same day, now beginning to avoid Ela. A series of events make Sanju believe that Varun is the stalker, but he denies so. In the meantime, Varun and Sanju stand in the election for the president of Westwood College of Law. On the evening of the same day, Vinnie comes to drop Sanju at her house and finds that someone is hiding in the bushes. When they come near the bush, the man tries to run away but is finally caught by them. When the man shows his face, it is Rohan. Sanju thinks the stalker is therefore Rohan. Sanju and Varun make their own teams with three to four people who will help them with sticking posters across the college and writing their speeches. Team members are naturally asked to vote for their respective leader. Sanju comes to know that Puru loves Vinnie. Thus, Sanju plans to tell Vinnie that Puru loves a girl named Chhaya, asking Vinnie to help in setting their love story. After pinning all of their posters across the college, everyone leaves to their respective homes. The next day, they arrive at the college, only to see that the stalker has written a love message on Sanju's posters. Sanju suspects the act to have been carried out by Rohan and tries to find him to no avail. In the evening, while Sanju was going to leave for her house after the day's college work, Ela and Vinnie wait for Sanju in the canteen. As she tries to leave, she finds that someone is following her. Afraid, Sanju tries to run but falls in the corridor. Hearing her screams, Vinnie and Ela come running and find Sanju lying in the corridor. They try to follow the stalker, who falls and gets hurt on his back. In spite of the injury, he rides on a bike and gets away. The scared BFFs go to the police for help. The police, arrest Rohan on the basis of reports from the BFFs, finding that he has gotten hurt on his back. The next day, the Inspector calls Sanju as Varun arrives to post bail for Rohan. Varun tells them the time that Sanju told the police about Rohan was following her, revealing that at that particular time, Rohan was with Varun. On the same day, the BFFs follow Rohan going to an illegal bike racing course. When Sanju asks him why he was following her, he tells her that Prithvi told him to watch her, revealing that he loves Sanju very much. He tells them that Varun knew Rohan was involved in illegal bike racing, so he released Rohan from the jail. Sanju asked him if Prithvi suspected Varun. Rohan answers that Prithvi had, but afterward, Prithvi changed his suspect from Varun to somebody else. When Sanju asks who the new suspect is, a car hits Rohan at a high speed. The BFFs take him to the hospital and call all of their friends, as well as Rohan's parents. After Rohan's operation, all of his friends, except Sanju and Varun, went to their respective homes. Sanju and Varun wait, but Rohan's parents do not arrive. In the night, the stalker comes, warning Rohan about telling anything to Sanju. In the morning, Sanju finds many of her previously lost possessions lying on the bench of the girl's locker room. While she surveys the items and photos, an onlooker takes pictures, pinning the images on the school notice board. As a result of the photos, her professors believe her to be a cheater. Ela gets an SMS revealing the truth: that Sanju told Mac to behave ignore Ela. Knowing this, Ela ends her friendship with Sanju. Ela and Vinnie try to find RGV, and Sanju finds that RGV's laptop is lying on the table of a classroom. Sanju tries to make the laptop work but when she comes closer to the laptop, college president voting automatically starts. When she turns back, she sees the professor. Professor Rickved then calls everyone to the assembly hall for voting. After voting, Sanju and Sahil go to have coffee in the canteen. Meanwhile, Rohan calls Sanju and asks her to come to a discreet location if she wants to know the stalker's identity. Rohan waits for Sanju, but a car arrives. Rohan thought that car to be Sanju's, but as he tries to reach forward he finds that it is the stalker. The stalker is revealed as Sahil, and Sahil kill Rohan. When Sanju reaches the location, she finds Rohan hanged and a suicide note that was left by Sahil. Varun helps the police in the investigation. Meanwhile, Anu comes to know that Sahil is the stalker and starts blackmailing him. While checking Rohan's diary, Sanjana is hit in the head by an unknown assailant and dragged to the garden. Vinnie and Puru find her unconscious and take her home. Rohan's dead body goes missing from the morgue. The next day, the police arrest Sanjana for stealing Rohan's body. Sanjana's father bails her out. Ela realizes her mistake and befriends Sanjana once more. The same night, Vinnie's car has some problems. When she opens the dikki, she finds Rohan's body, dumped by Sahil, based on the instructions of Professor Anu in a ploy to prove that Vinnie was also involved in Rohan's murder along with Sanju. Police trace Vinnie's car. Ela and Mac find out that Puru is also missing. Professor Rigved shows Sanju, Ela, and others a video in which a girl dressed up like Vinnie drags Rohan's body and places it in a car's dickey. Vinnie becomes a suspect for the crime, but Varun and Sanju prove Vinnie innocent by showing the entire college Puru and Vinnie's marriage video. Pammy admits that someone gave her the wig and dress to imitate Vinnie. They had told her she would need to do these things to be given an audition in an upcoming production. Later, it is revealed that Vinnie, upon finding Rohan's body in her dickey, fainted, but Puru found her and they fled. According to Varun's instructions, they hand over Rohan's body to his parents. Sanju recollects and realizes that Rohan's autopsy report is within her books. They decide to inform the police. Ela, Pammy, and Vinnie are sent to the shooting area to inspect the area. There, they find a baseball bat with Varun's name written on it. Though Vinnie and Ela start pondering over it, Pammy says Varun is being framed, and they should stand by him. In the meantime, they find someone eavesdropping, and it is none other than the stalker, who once again escapes. Varun gets a call from Megha and, to his utter dismay, Prithvi is in the last stage of his cancer. When Varun breaks this news to Pammy, Professor Anu hears it and texts Sanju, saying that Varun is playing a game with her by concealing information regarding Prithvi's supposedly declining health, only to have Sanju. Sanju is extremely guilty about distrusting Prithvi. She goes home with Ela and Vinnie but then tells them to leave her alone. Varun finds the person who took Pammy's auditions, but when they interrogate them, they realized that he is not the stalker. Sanju's father comes across Sahil in her bedroom. Sanju's friends get a diary from the stalker, which Ela keeps. Sanju gets a letter from Prithvi confessing his love to Sanju. Prithvi asks that Sanju should forgive Varun as he is trying to rectify his mistakes. Sanju and Varun patch up, as Sanju is shown hugging Varun. Once ordered to leave class, she gets out, followed by Varun. They plan to eat dinner together, but Sanju goes for a drive with Sahil when he ardently requests time with her. Sahil insists Sanju to keep driving further, and they eventually reach a place beautifully decorated where Sahil proposes to Sanjana. Mak and Ela are tensed as they did not find Sanju in her room, as she did not return home. Mac finds chewing gum in Sanju's room and notices a nearly identical one stuck inside the stalker's diary. He then realizes that Sahil is the stalker. Soon after, Puru and Vinnie find a laptop in the car which had hit Rohan. Varun then uses it to discover the stalker's hood in Sahil's locker. Sanju realizes that Sahil is the stalker when she switches her phone on as Ela sends a message to her regarding her security. Sanju gets confused and rushes out of the place. She then finds Varun and Pammi on the road. Sanju goes with them. The BFFs hatch a plan to trap Sahil. Sanjana calls Sahil and tells him that she also loves him, telling him to meet her in the college. Sanjana's backside is shown (who is actually Pammy). She asks him why he killed Rohan. Infatuated, he tells her the truth, causing her to then refuse to meet him at the college. Varun comes in the following scene. A fight then takes place between them, in which Sahil shoots Varun twice, causing Varun to fall down. Sanjana comes with a camera, recording the fight in its entirety. Everyone at the crime scene watches as Sahil is arrested by the police. While leaving, he demonstrates that Professor Anu has been blackmailing by dialing her phone from the number he keeps receiving demands from. Thus, he blames her. At this point, however, everyone ignores him, thinking his words to be an insane outburst. Now, the BFFs set out to find the female blackmailer. Sanju meets Sahil in hospital. As he prepared to reveal the truth about Professor Anu, she enters in the costume of a nurse, forcing Sanjana to leave the room. She injects Sahil with poison and Sahil gets paralyzed. Varun finds Rohan's bag and poison stored in Anu's room. He comes to realize that Anu is the blackmailer. He sends a message to all three girls through Pammy. The next day, everyone determines that Anu killed Rohan and poisoned Sahil. Frustrated, Anu reveals, in front of everyone, that she dumped Rohan's body in Vinnie's car. Sanjana records the entire confession, causing Anu to be arrested. The show takes a leap of 2 weeks (exams are over). Varun, Mac, and Puru cook food for the girls. Puru proposes to Vinnie for marriage. Mac and Ela promise to spend their life together. Sanju tells Varun that she is leaving for United States and that she will stay with Prithvi for his treatment. She also tells him that Pammy loves him very much. Hearing this, Varun states that he might patch up with Pammy. Someone is revealed to still be watching the group.

He was also nominated Gentilhombre de c√°mara con ejercicio (Gentleman of the Bedchamber) during the reign of the King of Spain Alfonso XIII. Biography Jos√© Ortiz-Echag√ºe was the second child of the military engineer Antonio Ortiz and his wife Dolores Echag√ºe. The couple had two daughters and five sons, one of whom died young as a military aspirant. At his birth, Jos√©'s father was a professor at the Academy of Military Engineers in Guadalajara. When the father, three years later, was appointed chief of the military garrison in Logro√±o, the capital of La Rioja, the family moved to Logro√±o, where Jos√© grew up and went to school. He used to consider himself a 'riojano'.Jos√© Antonio Vidal-Quadras: Ortiz-Echag√ºe y Navarra. Pr√≠ncipe de Viana, 54. Jahrgang, Nr. 198, 1993, S. 51-71 His three-year older brother, Antonio Ortiz-Echag√ºe, wanted to be a painter, even though in the family of the father and the mother there had been no known artists but several militaries. Antonio was therefore sent to Paris, and over the years he became an internationally known portrait painter of the early twentieth century. His work is found in an entire dedicated room in the Museo San Telmo in San Sebasti√°n, where their parents lived after the retirement of their father. In the beginning Jos√© Ortiz-Echag√ºe had aimed for himself to turn to painting too. He discovered the art of photography at the age of 12, when he received as a present his first photographic camera from an uncle who was military attach√© in Paris: it was a Kodak camera with which he took his first photographs and began to develop his artistic talent. In 1903, he made a photo in La Rioja during the sermon in a village church ('Sermon en la aldea'), for which he received the first prize in the following year at an exhibition in Vitoria. Already in 1904, the Spanish photo magazine 'Graphos Ilustrado' published a report on his photos. But being the son of an Andalusian military engineer and in order to respect his father's will since their finances did not allow to send a second son to Paris, in 1903 he joined the Academy of Military engineers in Guadalajara. Thereupon his training and graduation, he served in the Balloon unit during the Spanish-Moroccan War in North Africa. He acquired his aerostat and aircraft pilot license in 1911, being the third Spanish man awarded to it. Another distinction came in 1914, as he flew - along with Captain Herrera - first over the Strait of Gibraltar. In 1916 he married his wife Carmen Rubio in Madrid. The marriage resulted in eight children, three of whom are still alive today. Between 1909 and 1916 while he had moved to the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco, he started his photographic documentary passion, which he continued on his return to Spain. In his photo images he captured not only landscapes and monuments but also human beings as well as their rituals. As an entrepreneur and an engineer he is renowned for his work in the field of aviation and automobile industry. The beginning of his activity in the aircraft manufacturing business was marked in 1913 during his attempt to fly with a Morane-Saulnier from Paris to Madrid. When the plane caught fire, Ortiz-Echag√ºe not only managed to rescue himself as well as the engine undamaged, but he also brought it to Morocco and - in the middle of a military operation - used this for the construction of a new aircraft. After his final return from North Africa he founded in 1923 the aircraft manufacturer Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA (CASA) in Seville (licensed manufacturer by B√ºcker, Dornier, Heinkel, Junkers; today its successor EADS CASA is a partner in the construction of Airbus aircraft as a branch of EADS).Airbus Military History About Jos√© Ortiz-Echag√ºe Later, in 1950, he established the first assembly line Spanish car maker 'Sociedad Espa√±ola de Autom√≥viles de Turismo S.A.' (S.E.A.T. S.A.) becoming its first ever President to be eventually appointed its Executive President until 1976, a year when he was named Honorary lifetime President of this car company (since 1986 SEAT has been a subsidiary of the Volkswagen group). Being a pioneer throughout his life, in 1959, once again he was flying at the age of 72 years as a co-pilot in an F-100 Sabre of the United States Air Force, which - as happened at that time with all U.S. combat aircraft in Europe - had been repaired at the CASA factory. He was by then the oldest person to fly at supersonic speed. Photographic work Ortiz-Echag√ºe believed strongly on the one hand that Spain must modernize itself in accordance with the spirit of the times - inter alia by founding industrial companies - but on the other hand was well aware that a broad modernization could lead to disappearance of traditional clothing, a change in the villages and even a transformation of the landscape. He wanted at least to capture with his camera and hold this cultural heritage, before the change occurred.Ysabel de la Rosa: Time Traveler: Jos√© Ortiz Echag√ºe . Apogee Photo Magazine; o.D. Aesthetics In the field of artistic photography, he is perhaps the most popular photographer in Spain and one of the most well-known abroad. In 1935 the magazine 'American Photography' named him one of the top three photographers in the world, while some critics have also considered him to be one of the best Spanish photographers to date. This recognition becomes even more meritorious when it is considered that photography was a hobby to which he only devoted his spare time, especially during weekends and his various trips. From an artistic point of view one might consider him as a representative of the generation of '98 in photography, but he is also often included within the photographic movement of pictorialism, being in fact the best known representative of the Spanish photographic pictorialism, even though this late definition never liked to Ortiz-Echag√ºe. His photographic work focuses on portraying the most defining characteristics of a people, their customs and their traditional costumes as well as locations. He managed to project through his pictures a personal expression which is closer to painting, often using effects during photo processing. Echag√ºe remained faithful throughout his life to the aesthetics and techniques of pictorialism, including using gum bichromate and coal. Working technique Since 1898 when he got his first camera, he took thousands of photographs entirely in black-and-white. He exposed his negatives using a special technique similar to the carbon printing one ('carb√≥n fresson') which was the mainstream practice during his youth. Soon its use would become outdated, however he followed that technique throughout his art, giving a special hue and a greater contrast result to his positives, which now makes his work easily recognizable. Both paper-making as well as the procedure of obtaining photographs required a lot of patience, an extraordinary ability and a perfect management of that particular technique. Therefore, over the years and as photographic processes would become more simplified and automated, the few photographers still using this technique would tend to abandon it. The sheet had a thin layer of gelatin onto which was added a black pigment and it was sensitized to light. The photographer obtained his copies under a process based on the principle that in the parts of the image receiving less light the gelatin would remain soft whereas in the parts of the image receiving more light the gelatin would become hardened. The treatment of the copy - bathing in water and sawdust - dissolved the unhardened gelatin together with the pigment onto it revealing a white zone underneath, while the hardened gelatin resisted the bathing process, trapping the pigment inside and subsequently producing black areas. In this way the image on paper was exposed. But furthermore this printed image with the paper still wet, could be retouched using brushes and cotton swabs or scrapers, giving a lot of freedom for creativity. The ability to intervene in the final outcome of a photograph, the greater richness of tones given from the pigment and its stability were the main reasons that Jose Ortiz-Echag√ºe used this technique. Nevertheless, this archaic method is not considered to be the strongest component in his images. Without an intriguing subject, a good composition, well directed lights on models and the correct layout of the scene, the procedure of coal placed directly to Fresson paper would give a vulgar result. Cameras At the age of 12 Ortiz received his first camera, a present from an uncle: it was a Kodak camera which took 6 plates in 8 √ó 6.6 cm format. His second camera, which he got three years later, also a gift from a relative, and which he was using for five years, was a 'Photo Esph√®re' for glass plates in 9 x 12 cm format. In the years from 1903 to 1909, he used a 9 √ó 12 cm folding camera and a 15 √ó 18 cm travel camera with a wooden stand. The shots of costumes he captured were taken with a 13 √ó 18 cm travel camera with a Hermagis Eidoscope lens and a focal length of 26 cm (Lens speed f/5). In 1934 he used - especially for landscape shots - a 9 √ó 12 cm reflex camera and several lenses with focal lengths from 13 to 45 cm. In his last 20 years (until 1970), he used simultaneously, a Linhof Technika and - at that time press photographers were very popular in the USA - a Graflex Speed Graphic camera.Jose Ortiz- Echag√ºe: Spanien. Landschaften u. Portraits 1903 - 1964. Schirmer/Mosel Verlag, M√ºnchen 1979 Jos√© Ortiz-Echag√ºe in the 1960s adjusting his camera in front of some ruins in Avila, Spain Publications Ortiz-Echag√ºe himself made a classification of his works by grouping them into four books: * 'Tipos y Trajes' (1930) :In the series of 'Tipos y Trajes' (Characters and Outfits) we contemplate a Spanish society of a great folklore, yet we see portraits of a great human depth. It is hard not to be impressed by certain looks and behaviors of the characters portrayed, popular personages from streets in Spanish cities. * 'Espa√±a, Pueblos y Paisajes' (1939) :In 'Espa√±a, Pueblos y Paisajes' (Spain, Peoples and Landscapes) we see, beyond the mere reproduction of the monument or the landscape, the contrast between lands and peoples. * 'Espa√±a M√≠stica' (1943) :The series on 'Espa√±a M√≠stica' (Mystical Spain) focuses in cloistered religious communities and popular devotions such as pilgrimages and processions. In this series he presents portraits of monks reminiscent of Zurbar√°n or El Greco monks. * 'Espa√±a, Castillos y Alc√°zares' (1956) :The 'Espa√±a, Castillos y Alc√°zares' (Spain, Castles and Palaces) group could be considered a subcategory out of the series 'Espa√±a, Pueblos y Paisajes', but even if it is characterized by extreme dedication, there are very few examples of this series one of them being in possession of his friend Francisco Benito, server and family confidant in Madrid. To these collections two more series should be added: * 'Marruecos' :The 'Marruecos' (Morocco) series was realized during his stay between 1909 and 1916 as a military engineer in the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco. * 'Fotos familiares' :The 'Fotos familiares' (Family photos) are portraits realized for his family, many of which are of such high quality as those mentioned above. The values of his works are evident: the beauty and the magnificence of his photographs, the delicacy and the sensitiveness of his settings, his respect and affection for the traditional personas being portrayed. His photographs still provoke the same fascination as the time they were taken. His work has been republished many times, and has been exhibited in many places worldwide. He received many awards during his lifetime, both in Spain and abroad. Most of his work is kept in the 'Legado Ortiz-Echag√ºe' (Ortiz-Echag√ºe Legacy), in the University of Navarra, which holds approximately 1,000 original compositions performed under the 'carb√≥n fresson' technique, and more than 20,000 negatives.Fondo fotogr√°fico Universidad de Navarra: Legado Ortiz-Echag√ºe , 2005 The 'Museo del Traje' (Museum of Outfits) in Madrid, under the 'Centro de Investigaci√≥n del Patrimonio Etnol√≥gico' (Ethnological Heritage Research Center), preserves a good collection of photographs from the series 'Tipos y Trajes', acquired in 1933. Retrospective exhibitions In Berlin in 1929 an exhibition of his photographs was held and after that, his book 'Spanische K√∂pfe - Bilder aus Kastilien, Aragonien und Andalusien' was published.Jos√© Ortiz Echag√ºe: Spanische K√∂pfe - Bilder aus Kastilien, Aragonien und Andalusien. Ernst Wasmuth Verlag, T√ºbingen - Berlin, 1929. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York organized in 1960 a retrospective exhibition entitled 'Spectacular Spain', in which Ortiz-Echag√ºe appeared alongside artists such as Goya. This exhibition displayed eighty photographs of Ortiz-Echag√ºe. In 1998 the University of Navarra, owner of a great part of Ortiz-Echag√ºe's photographic collection, based on the selection made by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, organized a retrospective exhibition of photographs, spanning some sixty years of production until 1964. Since 1998 this selection has travelled around various museums and exhibitions, including the 'Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya' (National Art Museum of Catalonia), the H√¥tel de Sully in Paris (an exhibition entitled 'Mirages of Spain' in 1999), the 'Sala de Armas de la Ciudadela de Pamplona' (Hall of Arms of the Pamplona Citadel), the 'Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a' (National Art Museum Reina Sof√≠a) (the latter exceeding 150,000 visitors), the 'Palacio del Infantado' (Palace of Infantado') in Guadalajara, or even the 'Sala Am√≥s Salvador' (Hall of Am√≥s Salvador) in Logro√±o.

The novel series follows the protagonist Kaden Lane, a scientist who works on an experimental nano-drug, Nexus, which allows the brain to be programmed and networked, connecting human minds together. As he pursues his work, he becomes entangled in government and corporate intrigue. The story takes place in the year 2040. Nexus tied for Best Novel in the 2014 Prometheus Awards given out by the Libertarian Futurist Society. It was also shortlisted for the 2014 Arthur C. Clarke award. Nexus was published in 2012. Its sequel, Crux, was published in 2013. The third volume of the trilogy, Apex, was published in 2014, and won the 2015 Philip K. Dick Award. The film rights to Nexus were purchased by Paramount in 2013. Plot summary Nexus Samantha Cataranes (Sam), an agent for the Emerging Risks Directorate (ERD) of the United States government, arrives undercover at a party looking for Kaden Lane. Kaden is there testing Nexus 5, an illegal, experimental nano-drug for direct input and output of brain signals. Sam talks with Kaden about his work and he invites her to be a part of a Nexus 5 study. Sam goes to the study and meets Kaden's close friends and colleagues: Rangan Shankari, Ilya Alexander, and Watson Cole (Wats). Sam takes Nexus 5, connecting her mind with the others, and they discover who she is and Kade uses Nexus to knock her out. When Sam awakes she threatens the group with prison, and promises a pardon in exchange for Kade's help. Wats escapes before the ERD extracts the group. The ERD describe a mission to spy on Su-Yong Shu, a brilliant Chinese neuro-scientist who is implicated in murder and brain control coercion. Kade agrees to work with the ERD and hands over Nexus 5. Kade and the group are sent to retrieve the Nexus 5 data, and on the way, they install a backdoor into the Nexus 5 operating system. Sam is required to have permanent integration with Nexus 5, despite her disagreement with Warren Becker, the Enforcement Division Deputy Director at the ERD. Kade and Sam, now with the pseudonym of Robyn Rodriguez, travel to Bangkok for a conference that Kade is invited to by Shu. Wats follows in hopes of setting Kade free and spreading Nexus 5 to the general public. At registration, Kade hears an inspiring talk from Somdet Phra Ananda, discussing a Nexus-like topic, and meets Narong, a PHD student. Narong invites Kade to a student mixer the following night. After returning to the hotel Kade finds a secret note left by Wats, informing him of the possibility of escape if needed. Kade recognizes that he needs to stay and attempts to notify Wats, who however never receives the message. At the opening night reception Sam discovers Narong is a known associate of Suk Prat-Nung, a nephew of Thanom Prat-Nung, a Thai Drug Dealer. Sam decides it is important to continue to track Narong in hopes of catching the Thai drug ring leaders. Kade finds Shu and is invited for lunch the following day, later changed to a dinner as she meets first with Ananda. Kade also discovers that Professor Ananda is under the influence of Nexus. After returning to the hotel, Sam reviews tapes from the day and discovers the interaction between Ananda and Kade and that Ananda also followed Kade home. Sam also discovers that a note has been passed to Kade, however she does not know that it was from Wats. Kade meets with Shu for dinner where she reaches into his mind to discover what he knows. Kade fights back and employs a mantra to rearrange his memories. Shu reverses the effect and discovers that Kade is working with the ERD. Kade discovers that Shu is the first mind uploaded to a computer system. She is trans-human and attempts to convince Kade to join her in fighting humans. Kade asks for time to think about her proposal. She creates false memories so that Sam and the ERD will not discover their true conversation. Kade and Sam attend the student mixer to meet with Narong. He invites them to an after party in another area. On the way they go to Sukchai, an underground black market for everything trans- human. Kade realizes that legalizing these products would protect people, while Sam struggles with what is right. At the after party, Kade and Sam are invited to a Synchronicity party with Narong to try Nexus and another drug, Empathek. While leaving the party Sam and Kade are attacked. Sam defeats the attackers and calls for backup. The ERD backup arrives and extracts them. Sam confronts Kade about the interaction with Ananda, which Kade denies and arranges his memories to cover it up. The following day, Kade is approached by Shu at the conference. He recounts the previous nights events and Shu denies it was her people. Shu again tries to convince Kade that he should join the trans-humans. Kade takes a call from Ilya that reminds him that technology in the hands of only the elite is dangerous. Kade talks privately with Ananda. Ananda describes Buddhism as a democracy and how technology and knowledge must be shared. Meanwhile, Wats discovers that Suk Prat-Nung set up the ambush on Kade and Sam. He also discovers a plot to ambush them again during their Synchronicity party and sends an email to Kade to warn him. Sam sees the email and notifies ERD to be available in case of an ambush. At the Synchronicity party, Sam and Kade take Nexus and Empathek. They both use their mantras to change their memories. Sam, believing she is now Robyn Rodriguez, talks with Mai, a young girl that was born with Nexus abilities. Mai unlocks Sam's true memories and contributes to a great change inside Sam. Sam, overwhelmed by her sudden realization of the power of these drugs and released from her horrible past, talks with Kade. She releases his true memories and recounts her dark past. They both fall asleep. Upon waking they find Thanom Prat-Nung and his guards in the room. Narong, under the influence of Nexus 5 and the ERD, draws a gun on Thanom. Narong is killed by Thanom's guards and the ERD sends three team of men into the building, open firing despite Sam's warnings of civilians. Mai and the other members of the party are killed. Sam kills several ERD agents. Kade fights the ERD soldiers. Wats joins the fight and is killed. The ERD detonate explosions in the skulls of the soldiers. Sam and Kade escape. Suk Prat-Nung still alive, with a few of his men, continues to fight Sam and Kade. Kade is captured while Sam defeats some of Suk's men. Kade uses Nexus 5 to control the actions of his captor, Suk, to escape. Suk is killed. Feng, Shu's driver and a super soldier clone, rescues Kade and Sam, bringing them to a monastery. Sam and Kade spend some time recovering at the monastery while the ERD searches for them. An ERD recon spider robot discovers Sam and Kade's location, and the ERD sends a team to retrieve them. On her way to the monastery, Shu and Feng discover the ERD helicopters going to the monastery. They get a message to the monastery. Kade decides to mass distribute the Nexus 5 instructions. The ERD capture Kade placing him bound on a helicopter. Sam forces her way onto the helicopter, along with Feng. Shu takes control of the helicopter with her mind and forces it to return to the monastery. Before arriving two Thai fighter jets destroy the helicopters just as Kade, Sam, and Feng leap into a nearby lake. After returning to the monastery, the ERD recon spider robots shoots a neuro toxin at Kade and Shu. Feng cuts Kades right arm off to prevent the spreading of the toxin. Shu is killed. Nexus 5 is spread around the world, despite the efforts of government forces. Warren Becker, the Enforcement Division Deputy Director at the ERD, commits suicide. Kade uses gecko genes to grow back his arm. Crux Six months after the upload of the construction plan of the Nexus, a nano drug, which allows the brain to be programmed and networked, connecting human minds together, the world faces terrorism and massive abuse of the new technology. The Liberation Front, a terror cell secretly created and headed by the US- American government, spread terror in the name of posthumanism, to prevent people from using the new technology and bring up an atmosphere of two 'n' eight to take drastic measures against Nexus. In the meantime, our protagonist Kade and his new friend, clone warrior Feng, are fleeing from the CIA, which want see them both killed. On the elopement Kade is trying to stem the misuse of the nano drug to prevent a war between posthumans and humans. He has a code to the Nexus system that he can use to hack it. The secret services are very interested in the code. Ilya Aleander dies as prisoner because she didn't give the code to her turnkeys. Rangan Shankari can escape. Su-Yong Shu died in Nexus and now lives on as a computer intelligence and prisoner on a server belonging to the Chinese government. Ling Shu, her daughter, tries to help her mother escape. At the end of the book, the mother uses Ling Shus Nexus system to hack her brain and take over the body of her daughter. In Thailand, Samantha Cataranes helps in a protectory. Apex =Previous= A new nano cyber drug called Nexus is released in the year 2040. It connects human minds and allows the brain to be programmed. The protagonist Kaden Lane works on the illegal drug and is suddenly entangled in government intrigue. The nanomedicine is the breakthrough to posthumanism which governments and corporations fear and try to stop. Su-Yong Shu, a brilliant Chinese neuroscientist, with a mind uploaded to the network, tries to start a posthuman revolution. Soon Kaden Lane, who is summoned to spy on her, becomes her ally. The US American government hunts both and at the end Su-Yong Shu's physical body dies while her mind is isolated in a Chinese data center. Kaden Lane flees with his friends and makes the nano drugs available for all of humanity. As a result global unrest spreads with terrorists using the nano drug for assassination and governments trying to assassinate Nexus users. Meanwhile, Su-Yong Shu is nearly killed by the Chinese government by cutting off power to the data center. In the end she is rescued by her daughter. =Apex= The United States and China in particular and the Earth in general are aroused by disturbances. Unrest and riots spread with Nexus- upgraded protesters and police. Su-Yong Shu, the former dead neuroscientist who stole her daughter's body by downloading herself into it, tries to take over all electronic systems and with them the entire world, recreating it to fit her imagination. The posthumans are called Apex, the climax, and reinstatement of humankind. Film adaptions The film rights to the novel series were purchased by Paramount in 2013. Futurism themes The novel is heavily based in, and extends concepts in the author Ramez Naam's 2007 non- fiction work More Than Human: Embracing the promise of biological enhancement, in which the author argues for a technology like the fictional drug Nexus. Genetic enhancements The genetic enhancements to boost strength, speed, and stamina, as described in Nexus, are likely already possible, argued so by Ramez Naam. Operating system backdoor The Nexus backdoor that is created by Kade and Rangan in the novel is based on the Karger and Schell Multics backdoor, implemented experimentally by Ken Thompson, co-inventor of the Unix operating system.

With the support of the NAACP, Weir and a partner originally attempted to play at a United States Lawn Tennis Association's (USLTA)-sponsored indoor tournament in 1929, but they were turned away when organizers realized he was African-American. Later, in 1948, he successfully gained entrance to the USLTA's National Indoor Tournament in New York, becoming the first African-American man to play at a USLTA event. He won his first-round game on March 11, 1948, but did not advance further. His entrance to the tournament was the result of several years of lobbying by the ATA, and paved the way for Althea Gibson to be accepted and advance to the quarterfinals the following year.

Naming and history The Zak≈Çodzie meteorite was found beside a dirt road by Stanis≈Çaw Jachymek who was searching for fossils and rocks. The site lies south of the village Zak≈Çodzie (Lublin Voivodeship), after which the meteorite is named. A fireball, which may well have been the Zak≈Çodzie meteorite, was seen in the area of the find on 21 April 1897; its weathering is consistent with such an age. part slices were on sale at /g. Mineralogy The meteorite is composed of 60% orthoenstatite, 20% meteoric iron, 10% troilite and 10% feldspar. Accessory minerals include schreibersite, oldhamite, alabandite, keilite and amphibole. The meteoric iron has a Nickel content of 16%. The mineral composition is similar to an enstatite chondrite with strongly metamorphosed chondrules. A second interpretation is that the textures are a result of cumulate crystallization or an impact-melt breccia. It's the type locality of two minerals: browneite (IMA 2012-008) and buseckite (IMA 2011-070). Classification The meteorite was classified as an \\"ungrouped enstatite-rich meteorite\\" in 2000. In 2005 it was proposed that the meteorite was the product of magma crystallization and therefore an achondrite. The magma originated from the partial melt of an enstatite chondrite source. It was therefore proposed that the Zak≈Çodzie meteorite should be classified as a \\"primitive enstatite achondrite\\". It was classified as an Aubrite-an (anomalous) in 2006. Currently the recommended classification is that the Zak≈Çodzie meteorite is an ungrouped enstatite achondrite. Some scientists propose that many aubrites and enstatite achondrites are in fact impact breccias or impact-melt breccias. The later being proposed for Zak≈Çodzie and NWA 4301. The main arguments for this hypothesis are the relics of chondrules, the euhedral enstatites surrounded by meteoric iron and the occurrence of keilite. Keilite is possibly a product of reactions that take place when enstatite achondrites are melted and quenched (a quick decrease in temperature). This could happen during impact events on the surface of the parent body.

He pioneered electronic intermedia, and is a painter, sculptor, and poet. Childhood Aldo Tambellini was born in Syracuse, New York, the second child of an Italian-Brazilian father, John Tambellini, and an Italian mother. At the age of 18 months his mother legally separated from his father. This prompted John Tambellini to move the family from Syracuse back to Italy, to the township of Lucca in Tuscany. He then returned to New York, and Aldo Tambellini saw him only when he visited Lucca. Tambellini grew up in Italy speaking Italian. His paternal grandfather, Paul Tambellini was a Coffee plantation owner in S√£o Paulo, Brazil who later retired to Lucca. His maternal grandfather was a socialist who worked in the foundry, building railroad cars. Tambellini grew up primarily with his family on his mother's side, who came from the Massa region of Tuscany. He showed early promise in fine arts as a child, drawing and painting with great skill at the age of 3. At the age of 5 Tambellini's mother gave him his first battery operated Laterna Magica projector. Yet he loved both music and art, singing as a child and listening to the radio frequently. When he reached the age of 10 he entered grammar school, where his mother had to choose between art and music for his specialisation. She chose the local arts school, A. Passaglia Art Institute (not far from where Puccini lived). There he studied art history and fine arts. Shortly after, Italy under Mussolini entered World War II as an ally of the Nazi regime, interrupting Tambellini's studies, but making an indelible impression on his artistic process. During the 6 January 1944 raid on Italy, Tambellini was out of the house riding his bikes. Soon, bombs hit Lucca. Tambellini survived the attack unscathed, later recalling that bombs dropped five feet from him as he lay in the street. His family also survived, with two bombs in the backyard failing to detonate. 21 of his neighbors and friends perished that day. Tambellini notes that his mother never fully recovered emotionally. His family then moved further north to the town of Guamo. Guamo was occupied by German youth soldiers during this time. In an interview with Femficatio, Tambellini discusses a particular young German soldier who liked art and used to admire his watercolors, and who also shared his feelings: \\"He didn't like the war either.\\" At the end of the war, Guamo was liberated by Buffalo Soldiers (African-American GIs), which also influenced his art. After Lucca was liberated, Tambellini was able return there and finish his studies at the Art Institute. There, Tambellini volunteered to paint the scenery for, and act in a play written by Italian Veterans at the hospital in Lucca. Tambellini also painted a mural for the American GI Club. Early life As he was born in America, Tambellini had birthright citizenship in America. Earlier in the war, his older brother, also an American Citizen, was drafted into the US Army. At the age of 16, Tambellini moved to New York City with his mother, speaking very little English. Tambellini first learned of his parent's official separation on arriving in New York. He then took care of his mother who had developed extreme paranoia and other neuroses due to the war. Tambellini took a series of odd jobs, picking potatoes with migrant workers and painting gasoline tanks in Oil City in Syracuse, New York. While stepping on wet paint, he slipped toward the tank's unsecured edges and stopped a few inches from a sixty-foot drop ‚Äì a plunge that could have killed him. After that, Tambellini enrolled in a local vocational college to learn English. While there, he won numerous prizes and awards in art. Shortly after, at the age of 17, Tambellini prepared his portfolio and met with Lee Brown Coye (illustrator of \\"Weird Tales\\") at the Syracuse Museum. Coye was an instructor in painting there. After reviewing Tambellini's work, he recommended him to Anna Holmstead, the Director of the Museum that hired Tambellini to teach painting. He was the youngest faculty member on staff. At 18, Tambellini joined VEDET, which consisted of artists Hilton Kramer (who later became conservative critic for The New York Times) and James Kleege. There, Tambellini applied for a four-year scholarship to the University of Syracruse. With only two scholarships offered, Tambellini secured one in their prestigious BFA program. After receiving his BFA, he took a teaching position at the Rosary Hill College in Buffalo, New York. Then received a Teaching Fellowship from the University of Oregon where he matriculated. After a year, he transferred to another teaching Fellowship at Notre Dame, where he studied sculpture with Ivan Me≈°troviƒá. He received his MFA from Notre Dame in 1959. Lower East Side artists After completing his MFA, Tambellini moved to the Lower East Side, Manhattan, where he rented a $56.00 a month studio above a shop. There, he entered the art scene as a professional artist, and founded major artistic movements and held principal membership in other historic artistic movements during the 1960s and 1970s post-war arts scene. In 1962, Tambellini was a founding member of a counter-culture group called Group Center, which worked to find creative ways to display non-mainstream work. Other founding members include Ron Hahne, Elsa Tambellini, Don Snyder, and Ben Morea. Notable members who came on board later were Jackie Cassen and Peter Martinez. A major group highlighting the intermedia genre, \\"Group Center\\" combined poetry, photography, choreography and film-making. In a flyer distributed by the Group highlighting its intentions it read: In Group Center, Tambellini first began to work with \\"black\\" as a theme, which came to define his artistic expression. Beginning as an avant-garde filmmaker, in 1965 Tambellini began to paint directly on film, a technique he pioneered, thus beginning his \\"Black Film Series.\\" Shortly after, with a second-hand Bolex camera, Tambellini shot several experimental films. One of which, \\"Black TV\\" won the International Grand Prix, Oberhausen Film Festival in 1969. As well as his involvement in Group Center, Tambellini worked closely with the Umbra poetry collective. Tambellini was close friends at the time with N.H. Pritchard, but later became friends with Tom Dent (founding member of Umbra who met across from Tambellini's studio), as well as Askia Tour√©, Ishmael Reed and Brenda Walcott. There, through his collaboration with the black activist literary community, Tambellini pushed the bounds of intermedia to moving electromedia shows that involved him painting directly onto cellulose slides that were run through a projector; accompanied by a dancer, jazz, and poetry. His electromedia performances often included the poetry and voice of Calvin C. Hernton, as in the case with his work, Black Zero. These performances evolved over time, each show building upon the next, with the core team including N.H. Pritchard, Ishmael Reed, and Carla Black. Later the dancer Carla Black was changed to an African-American woman, Beverley Schmidt, in keeping with the Black theme, and that show was re-titled \\"Black2\\". These shows brought Tambellini to prominence with the Herald Tribune remarking that this was \\"Tambellini's Rebellion in Art Form\\". In 2009, Performa 09, the NYC performance biennial, hosted a memorable recreation of Black Zero at White Box (34 years after it premiered at the Astor Playhouse in 1965) featuring William Parker and Hill Greene on double basses and Ben Morea on clamorous machines, among others. In 2011, the Chelsea Art Museum was host to yet another recreation of Black Zero, as part of Tambellini's museum retrospective there. Both performances were produced by Swiss conceptual artist Christoph Draeger, who invited bass legend Henry Grimes to join this time. The musical improvisations accompany simultaneous slide- and film projections by Aldo Tambellini and his team of eight performers, and sound recordings by the late Calvin Hernton's radical poetry. The 2012 re-creation at the Tate Tanks of the 1965 Astor Playhouse performance in New York City noted the many Group Center artists involved‚Äîwith Aldo Tambellini and Elsa Tambellini on projectors, Ben Morea on the clamorous machines, Ron Hahne on the spiral machine, Bill Dixon playing the horn, Alan Silva bass, and Calvin C. Hernton's recorded poetry and voice. In 1966, Tambellini founded The Gate Theater in New York's East Village, which showed experimental films once a week. Nam June Paik and Hollywood director Brian de Palma's first films were shown in Tambellini's theater, the only avant-garde experimental theater to show independent films of the time. In 1967, he co-founded a second theater, the Black Gate with Otto Piene, which primarily showed electromedia performances and installations. Aldo Tambellini was also a member of the NO!art movement, becoming close friends with founding NO!artist Boris Lurie. No!art was a major intermedia movement, whose work dealt directly with WWII themes and the Holocaust, both of deep significance to Tambellini. Tambellini's work has been exhibited with other NO!artists throughout the East Coast.  Post Millennial Exhibitions and Activities  In June 2010 Tambellini exhibited in a group show, Celluloid Cameraless Film at the Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt Germany One of Aldo Tambellini's projected works, at an open air installation in 2014. Pictured with it is Holly Payne-Strange, who also appeared in Tambellini's \\"Circle in the Square\\" based on footage taken at this installation. Photo by Alex John Gilbey November 2011 saw a Tambellini retrospective presented at the Chelsea Museum, New York ‚Äì Black Zero (1966‚Äì1999). The retrospective included an evening performance of Black Zero and a continuous projection of Tambellini's early works. This exhibition was sponsored by the Boris Lurie Foundation. In October 2012 Tambellini exhibited in the Tate Tanks at London's Tate Modern. The program included screenings of two of his performance pieces Black Zero and Moondial, screenings of his Black Film Series and other films from his 1960s Era. The installation Retracing Black now forms part of Tate Modern's permanent collection. In September 2013 Tambellini had his first gallery retrospective at the James Cohan Gallery, New York. In 2015 Tambellini was invited to exhibit in the Italian Pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale. His work, displayed in the Arsenale Complex, included a new installation ‚Äì a multi-screen projected work entitled Study of Internal Shapes and Outward Manifestations and a series of 2D illustrations entitled Memory Atlas. In September of the same year his installation work Atlantic in Brooklyn 1971‚Äì72, Morning, Noon and Night, was displayed in The Boiler in Brooklyn, New York. Consisting of video footage shot from his apartment window at the intersection of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues, the work was digitally re-mastered and projected on six large screens. The fall of 2015 also saw Tambellini's video work The Circle in the Square projected at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center as part of their Art on the Marquee Project. This work was filmed at an open air Tambellini installation in August 2014, and featured actress and model Holly Payne-Strange. In 2016 The Aldo Tambellini Art Foundation was created. It is dedicated to the advancement of the works of Tambellini and the protection and promotion of contemporary art. Furthermore the Foundation seeks to ensure Tambellini‚Äôs works are accessible to all via permanent placements and loans in galleries and museums throughout the world. The foundation seeks to support and encourage emerging artists of all disciplines that resonate with the philosophy of Tambellini. This mission includes the care, preservation and restoration of Tambellini‚Äôs work. Media Tambellini has over 1400 pieces of artwork and 1000 poems. Femficatio Literary Magazine, Vol. 1, Issue 7 He has worked in bronze. He works with coal, acrylic and oil paints for his paintings. His earliest intermedia works involved the painting of cellulose slides and the use of projectors and televisions. His electromedia performances were collaborative efforts, utilizing jazz, poetry and dance along with painted slides. Tambellini is also a film editor and creates visual poems. Tambellini's films often deal with propaganda and perceptions. His major film \\"Black TV\\" took snaps and clips from television, where he edited scenes side by side. His films were often Black and White, surreal, and had a social context. In 2006 his short film \\"Listen\\" won for Best Experimental film at the Syracuse International Film Festival. Tambellini often noted communication as an artistic medium. In 1968 in the Video History Project he said: Aldo Tambellini was a pioneer in the video-art movement. His first video-tape was broadcast by ABC TV News in New York in 1967. Tambellini became Fellow at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1976. From 1976‚Äì1984 Aldo conducted courses and workshops in communication and media, as well as participating in live experimental events in slow-scan in the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia. Most of his experiments revolved around slow scan. While at CAVS he participated in \\"Arts Electronica\\" in Vienna, Austria and lectured on Aesthetics and Technology at the Institute of Design in Offenbach am Main, Germany. In 1980, Tambellini founded Communicationsphere, a network of artists, performers, technicians, and engineers who were interested in the impact of telecommunications on the changing modern society.

Dewdney's books have been translated into more than thirteen languages, including: Chinese, Hebrew, Korean, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Polish, Spanish, Russian, Latvian,https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=Anna+Dewdney&fq;=dt%3Abks&dblist;=638&fc;=ln:_25&qt;=show_more_ln%3A Romanian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36492267-lama-lama-in-pijama Hungarian,http://mokka.hu/web/guest/record/-/record/bibMOK06664900 Italian,https://www.amazon.it/fatto-Piccola-ruspa-Anna-Dewdney/dp/8804711809/ and German.https://www.rowohlt.de/autor/anna-dewdney.html Partial proceeds from some of her works go toward environmental awareness and conservation efforts, most notably pangolin conservation in southeast Asia.http://www.wwct.org.uk/userfiles/pagefiles/conservation- research/vietnam/carnivore-pangolin/Newsletter%202011%20Aug%20-%20CPCP.pdf In 2016 it was announced that Reed Duncan had adapted Dewdney's Llama Llama titles as an animated children's television series for Netflix. The show was released by Genius Brands and was initially directed by Rob Minkoff and Saul Andrew Blinkoff. Jane Startz served as the series producer and Joe Purdy was the series showrunner. Reed Duncan, the show's co-creator, served as executive producer. Duncan, Startz, and Purdy wrote and created all of the show's main storylines. Dewdney and Duncan wrote the lyrics to the signature theme song. The show, starring Jennifer Garner as Mama Llama, contains approximately 50 episodes and is currently in its second season on Netflix. The series has been translated into over 22 different languages and is broadcast in dozens of countries worldwide.  Influences  Dewdney cites Tasha Tudor, the early work of Maurice Sendak, Russell Hoban, Garth Williams, Barbara Cooney, Elizabeth Goudge, Frances Hodgson Burnett, William Steig, E. B. White, Munro Leaf, and Robert Lawson as creative influences.  Awards and honors  Dewdney's Llama Llama books have all been New York Times bestsellers, and several titles have reached #1 on the list. Her books regularly make the Publisher's Weekly and IndieBooks bestsellers lists and have hit buzzworthy sales figures. Llama Llama Red Pajama was chosen as Jumpstart's Read for the Record book in 2011, setting the world's record for most readings of a particular book on one day. This event was recorded on the Today show on October 6, 2011, where her work was read live to the national television audience. Her work has been adapted into stage plays, dance performances, and musicals, most notably by Dolly Parton at Dollywood.\\"Dollywood Penguin Players Bring Kids‚Äô Book to Life\\" The Dolly Parton Foundation has also chosen her Llama Llama series for The Imagination Library, a not-for-profit organization serving young children through book donations. Many states and not-for-profit organizations use her books for literacy campaigns and programs, including the Library of Congress, which featured her work and a live reading by Anna in its 2012 National Book Festival. Dewdney's work is highly acclaimed by critics and is often recommended on booklists by national reviewers.

He was perhaps best known for his proprietorship of the Sadler's Wells Theatre and for the pantomimes and satirical farces that he wrote, and which were staged at many theatres across London. He employed Joseph Grimaldi at Sadler's Wells where Grimaldi appeared in many of his most successful pantomimes. He was the son of Charles Dibdin, brother of Thomas John Dibdin and godson of David Garrick. Biography Early life and career Born in Russell Court, Covent Garden, London as the illegitimate son of composer Charles Dibdin and the actress Harriett Pitt, Dibdin was named after his father's friend and librettist Isaac Bickerstaffe and their character Mungo in an afterpiece entitled The Padlock. Dibdin made his theatrical debut opposite his younger brother Thomas John Dibdin (b. 1771) in his godfather David Garrick'sMcConnell Stott, p. 80 The Jubilee in 1775. Soon after this performance, his parents separated, and Dibdin changed his surname to his mother's maiden name, Pitt.Kilburn, Matthew. \\"Dibdin, Charles Isaac Mungo\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, accessed December 2012 Dibdin's mother was initially against her son following a theatrical career and so arranged for him to start an apprenticeship for his uncle Cecil Pitt, a furniture-maker, who worked in central London.McConnell Stott, p. 79 Dibdin commenced his schooling in Hackney, then moved to County Durham where, at the age of nine, he enrolled at a boarding-school at Barnard Castle, remaining there until the age of 14, without a holiday. When he was 14, Dibdin returned to London and began an apprenticeship for a pawnbroker, which he continued for several years. Keen to realize a literary ambition, Dibdin published a collection of verse, Poetical Attempts: by a Young Man in 1792 and along with his brother Thomas, wrote the Christmas pantomime The Talisman; or, Harlequin Made Happy in 1796.Findlater, p. 60 In 1797 he recommenced his performing career at the Royalty Theatre in London in a one- man show called Sans six sous and became known professionally as Charles Dibdin the younger. The same year, he married the actress Mary Bates at St George's, Hanover Square, London on 13 June; the couple had eleven children. Among them were Mary Anne (1799‚Äì1886), a harpist who became the second wife of the controversialist Lewis Hippolytus Joseph Tonna, and Robert William (1805‚Äì1887), a clergyman and father of Sir Lewis Tonna Dibdin. Soon after his marriage, Dibdin sold a pantomime, based on the novel Don Quixote,McConnell Stott, p. 93 to Philip Astley who further contracted Dibdin for a three-year engagement as a writer at Astley's Amphitheatre. Dibdin recalled the eccentric atmosphere at Astley's in his memoirs: \\"the Astleyian fancy was apt to be fascinated by such an Exhibition.\\"Dibdin, p. 118 Astley was known for his strict, fearsome reputation and insisted on starving his actors until after their act, using food as a reward for good performances.Bunn, p. 59Dibdin, p. 20 Astley ordered Dibdin to produce twelve burlettas, twelve pantomimes and twelve harlequinades a year. In 1799, Dibdin was offered a contract by the Sadler's Wells manager Richard Hughes to write pantomimes and harlequinades for the following year's season,McConnell Stott, p. 94 including Harlequin Benedick; or, The Ghost of Mother Shipton and The Great Devil, both starring Joseph Grimaldi.Findlater, p. 85 Peak years Dibdin and his wife conducted a tour with the Astley company, travelling to Dublin and Liverpool as well as performing in London. It was during this period that Dibdin became a fluent and prolific composer, writing many songs, prologues, epilogues, and one-act musical plays. In 1799, Dibdin left Astley and sought alternative employment following his wife's dismissal for sewing during rehearsals. That autumn, the Dibdins joined a touring equestrian company, managed by William Davis and toured to such cities as Liverpool, Bristol, and Manchester. The Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1809 In 1800, Dibdin took over as manager at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London with the pantomime ballet Filial Love, or the Double Marriage being one of the first pieces to be staged under his managership.McConnell Stott, p. 97 He hired a band of notable performers, including Edmund Kean and Joseph Grimaldi as well as many singers, tightrope- walkers, and pugilists. Throughout the seasons, he introduced many of his self-composed works that met the varied public taste. These spectacles improved the fortunes of Sadler's Wells, and by 1802 he, his brother Thomas and a syndicate of wealthy businessmen, including the scene painter Robert Andrews and composer William Reeve, became shareholders in the theatre.McConnell Stott, p. 124 In 1803‚Äì4, Dibdin installed a large water tank and advertised the venue as an aquatic theatre that performed aqua dramas. On 15 October 1807, eighteen people were killed in a stampede to escape when a mistaken fire alarm was given at the theatre. Although his proprietorship survived the disaster, the Napoleonic wars of 1803-1815 had ruined public demand for Dibdin's type of entertainment, and his fortunes fell until, in 1819, he was declared bankrupt and was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. He was released two years later upon the sale of his shares in Sadler's Wells which bought him out of debt. He continued with his compositions, writing many songs and pantomimes for various London theatres and took up the role of stage director at the Royal Amphitheatre from 1822‚Äì23 and manager of the Surrey Theatre from 1825‚Äì26. Later years Dibdin published a number of poems including Young Arthur, or, The Child of Mystery: a Metrical Romance in 1819. He completed A History of the London Theatres which was published in 1826 to much acclaim. His last theatrical composition was the farce, Nothing Superfluous, which was produced in Hull in 1829. The following year, he completed his memoirs, but they were not published until discovered in 1956. He died in 1833 at the age of 63 and was buried at St James's Chapel, Pentonville.McConnell Stott, p. 307\\"Death of Mr. Charles Dibdin\\", Morning Post, 19 January 1933, p. 3 In 2010 a musical artwork dedicated to Dibdin was installed during the park's refurbishment. The author Andrew McConnell Stott noted \\"[Dibdin] was a cheerful, tireless and frequently prosperous man with a love of patriotic ballads and convivial dinners.\\"McConnell Stott, p. 92 Notes and references ;Notes ;References Sources  External links * Category:1768 births Category:1833 deaths Category:18th-century English male actors Category:19th-century English male actors Category:English composers Category:English dramatists and playwrights Category:English male dramatists and playwrights Category:English male stage actors Category:Male actors from London Category:People from Covent Garden Category:People imprisoned for debt ","title":"Charles Dibdin the younger"},{"id":"37984792","text":"Ta≈üoluk is a village in the District of Bolu, Bolu Province, Turkey.

It is endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico. Taxonomy First considered a Mexican population of Storeria occipitomaculata by Storer in 1839, Storeria hidalgoensis was described as separate species in 1942 by Taylor. In 1944 it was reassigned as a subspecies of Storeria occipitomaculata by Trapido, and then in 1993 Flores-Villela reinstated it to full species rank, based partly on allopatry. Some feel that this re-evaluation to full species rank requires additional study. The holotype of this species is deposited at the University of Illinois Museum of Natural History (Specimen no. 25061). It is a male collected by E.H. Taylor on 13 August 1938. Geographic range It is found in the eastern and south-central regions of the central Mexican plateau where it ranges from Nuevo Le√≥n, through Tamaulipas and eastern San Luis Potos√≠ to northeastern Hidalgo at elevations between above sea level. Description Adults are small and somewhat slender with a maximum length of . Dorsal body color varies from gray to light brown, tan, reddish, or dark brown (grayish to dark brown in preservative) usually with small gray flecks but no dark spots or crossbands. Ventral coloring is either gray to pink, or may have dark gray pigment at least laterally. Its head is black, especially posteriorly, with small gray flecks. A dark wedge-shaped mark lies behind each parietal and a light spot is usually present within the mark. Labials are either gray, or contain variable amounts of dark pigment with the fifth supralabial being the lightest of the series. The dorsal scales are without pits with some faintly keeled. Habitat This is a terrestrial species that occurs in primary and secondary cloud forest, pine forest, pine-oak forest and fir forests. Reproduction Storeria hidalgoensis are viviparous. Diet The biology of these snakes is poorly known and further study has been recommended. Etymology The specific name, hidalgoensis, is composed of hidalgo-, which refers to the Mexican state in which the type specimen was collected, and the Latin suffix -ensis, which means \\"belonging to\\".

He played for several years for a variety of teams in the National Basketball Association, as well as in the Continental Basketball Association and in Europe. He is also known for his standout college career at Idaho State University, where he is recognized as one of the best players in the school's history. College career Born in American Falls, Idaho, Hayes attended Aberdeen High School in Aberdeen. A center, he enrolled at Idaho State University in nearby Pocatello. As a freshman, Hayes averaged 9.8 points and 6.8 rebounds per game and was a valuable contributor to a Bengals team that went won a share of the Big Sky Conference title, and won a tiebreaker playoff game to earn a berth in the NCAA tournament. As a sophomore, he developed into one of the top players in the conference, averaging 20.4 points and 13.3 rebounds. Hayes led the Big Sky in scoring and rebounding and earned first team All-Conference honors. In his junior season, Hayes again earned first team All-Conference accolades, averaging 19.7 points and 10.6 rebounds per game (leading the conference in both statistical categories). The Bengals again tied for the conference regular-season title, but did not play in the postseason. His final collegiate season in 1976‚Äì77 was a special one for Hayes and the Bengals. Hayes again averaged a double-double at 20.2 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. He was named first team All-Big Sky for the third consecutive year, becoming only the third player in league history to do so. Idaho State went in league play to win the regular season championship and captured their first Big Sky Tournament title at home to clinch a berth in the 32-team NCAA tournament. Once there, the Bengals made the most of their opportunity. After a win over Long Beach State in the first round of the West regional on their home court, ISU faced national power UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen in Provo, Utah. The Bruins were going for their eleventh consecutive Final Four appearance - an NCAA record. Hayes scored 27 points and recorded 12 rebounds as the Bengals upset UCLA as Hayes was named to the All-Regional team. At the close of his career, Hayes finished second in school history in scoring (1,933 points) and first in rebounding (1,147) and blocked shots (207). He also holds the Big Sky Conference records for total rebounds in a career, career blocked shots per game (3.51) and blocked shots in a game (10 in 1976). He was inducted into the Idaho State athletic Hall of Fame in 1988. Professional career Hayes was drafted in the fourth round of the 1977 NBA Draft by the New York Knicks (76th pick overall), but did not make the final roster. Instead, he signed with Fernet Tonic Bologna in Italy, where he played for two seasons, averaging 19.3 points and 8.6 rebounds per game. For the 1979‚Äì80 season, Hayes returned to the United States to play for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association, where he teamed up with future NBA players Brad Davis and Ron Davis to win the 1980 CBA championship. Hayes averaged 19.7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 3.0 blocks per game in the playoffs (up from his regular season averages of 11.6, 7.8 and 1.5 respectively) and was named CBA Playoff MVP.1989-90 CBA Official Guide and Register, page 267 Hayes returned to Italy for the next season and averaged 18.1 points and 10.7 rebounds for Tai Ginseng Gorizia. For the 1981‚Äì82 season, Hayes finally made his NBA debut for the San Antonio Spurs on December 30, 1981. He split the season between the Spurs, Detroit Pistons and Anchorage Northern Knights. The next couple of seasons, Hayes played a reserve role for several NBA teams: the Cleveland Cavaliers, Seattle SuperSonics, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Utah Jazz. His career NBA averages over five seasons were 2.5 points and 2.6 rebounds per game. In the middle of his time with the NBA, Hayes had a standout season for the Tampa Bay Thrillers of the CBA in 1984‚Äì85. He averaged 20.5 points and 8.9 rebounds per game and was named CBA MVP for the season. He also played parts of two seasons with the Rapid City Thrillers and Cedar Rapids Silver Bullets after his last NBA game. His career CBA averages were 14.7 points and 8.1 rebounds per game. Hayes also played briefly in France after the completion of his United States career. Coaching career and life after basketball Following the close of his playing career, Hayes became an assistant coach for the CBA's Cedar Rapids Silver Bullets in 1990, then was named head coach of the Rockford Lightning for the 1990‚Äì91 CBA season, leading the team to a 23-33 record.1992-93 Official CBA Guide and Register, page 151 He then moved to the Tri-City Chinook to become the team's head coach and general manager. In two seasons with the Chinook, Hayes compiled a 42-46 record.1994-95 Official CBA Guide and Register, page 160 Hayes stepped away from professional basketball in 1994 to accept a fundraising role in the Idaho State athletic department.

The event was held in 12 major Canadian cities in 2013, 25 cities in 2014, and 30 cities in 2015. Recovery Day is organized in part by Faces and Voices of Recovery. Recovery Day is an important holiday for Canadians. Origins AnnMarie McCullough and Lorinda Strang of the Orchard Recovery Center on Bowen Island developed the concept of Recovery Day based on similar recovery advocacy movements in the United States. In the US, September is officially recognized by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services) as \\"Recovery Month.\\" In order to build a strong team to lead their initiative, Lorinda and AnnMarie joined with David Berner and Chuck Doucette of the Drug Prevention Network of Canada as well as Giuseppe Ganci of the Last Door and they began planning a Canadian equivalent based on the same principle of celebrating recovery from addictions. September 30, 2012 was declared Recovery Day through an official proclamation from Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson. The idea of Recovery Day spread to other major Canadian cities such as Victoria where a similar event was also held in Centennial Square. Ottawa's mayor signed a similar proclamation. The following year, 12 cities hosted events. In 2014, 20 cities held Recovery Day events. Close to 30 cities held events in 2015. Event More than 600 people gathered in front of the Vancouver Art Gallery on September 30, 2012. The event included speakers sharing stories of their experience and gratitude, musical performances, speeches by local politicians (including MP John Weston, Parks Board Commissioner Constance Barnes, City Councilor Geoff Meggs, and MLA Randy Hawes) and a march through the streets of Downtown Vancouver. The event closed with over 400 people joining hands in a circle to recite the Serenity Prayer. Upcoming Recovery Day is scheduled to be held in dozens of Canadian cities in September 2017. Observances in the United States On August 31, 2017, President Donald Trump proclaimed September as National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month.

Excavations have uncovered a hieroglyphic stairway depicting sculpted representations of bound captives, captured by Yuknoom Ch'een I, a Kan dynasty king of Dzibanche. One of these captives is named as Yax K'ahk' Jolo'm and, although his place of origin is not mentioned in the accompanying text, the form of his name indicates that he came from a city relatively close to Dzibanche itself.Vel√°squez Garc√≠a 2005, p. 3. At least two of sculpted blocks may date to the 5th century AD. The most important structures at Dzibanche include the Temple of the Captives, the Temple of the Lintels and the Temple of the Owl. The K'inichna' Pyramid is a large temple located outside of the site core. The Lamay Group is a small outlying architectural group that formed a part of the city.Witschey and Brown 2011, p. 122. The Cormoranes Pyramid is the largest pyramid at Dizibanche. It was built during the 5th century AD using the Teotihuacan-influenced talud- tablero style of Maya architecture. The pyramid is decorated with friezes that were sculpted from stucco and coated with red paint; the friezes feature symbols that are also in the Teotihuacan style. The structure is the funerary pyramid of Sky Witness, one of the kings of the Kan dynasty.Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 138. The K'inich Na' Pyramid (\\"House of the Sun God\\") is a large pyramid approximately north of the site core. Two royal burials were discovered inside the structure, accompanied by jade offerings. The K'inich Na' Pyramid is surrounded by a number of smaller palace-type structures and the group is linked to the site core by a causeway. The group was likely to be the home of an elite lineage group and was placed to extend the city's region of control over the northern parts of the surrounding bajo.

The bandage dress was created by Azzedine Ala√Øa and is most closely associated with the designer Herv√© L√©ger.McKean, Erin. (2013) The Hundred Dresses: The Most Iconic Styles of Our Time, A&C; Black. . p19 Actress Rachel Weisz wearing a bandage dress in 2008 at the Toronto International Film Festival. Description According to Max Azria, \\"[a] bandage dress isn't a woven, it's all knitted on a knitting machine and is a completely different concept...People assume it's cut-and-sew, but there's no cutting. It's knitted in a panel and then attached\\". Bandage dresses are noted for accommodating a broad variety of body styles due to the stretchy fabric. The material in a bandage dress is heavy and provides some contouring; not every dress with the bodycon silhouette provides this same shaping element. History Azzedine Ala√Øa, the \\"King of Cling\\", included bandage dresses in his collections in the mid-1980s. Singer Grace Jones wore a bandage dress from the designer's spring/summer 1986 collection as she carried him onstage to accept his Best Designer of the Year award at the 1985 Oscars de la Mode. Herv√© L√©ger introduced his own bandage dresses in the early 1990s. A 1993 New York Times review of one of his runway shows remarked that his apparent specialty was \\"girdle-tight dresses\\" made from strips of fabric, creating what they termed the \\"sexy mummy look\\". When BCBGMAXAZRIA acquired L√©ger's brand in the late 1990s, the bandage dress reached a wider audience. After BCBG Max Azria released a capsule collection of the Herv√© L√©ger dress in 2007, bandage dresses enjoyed a period of red carpet ubiquity lasting through the early 2010s.

The New York Times. October 13, 1994. Some of Kahn's more celebrated signings include John Creasey, Patricia Highsmith, Julian Symons, Dick Francis, and Tony Hillerman. Early life Born and raised in New York City, Kahn was the eldest child of architect Eli Jacques Kahn and Elsie [Plaut] Kahn, and the sister of writer E.J. Kahn. An alumna of the Horace Mann School, the Yale School of Art, Barnard College, and the Art Students League of New York, Kahn wrote one children's book (which she also illustrated),\\"Latest Books Received\\". The New York Times Book Review. October 9, 1938. See also: *\\"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SAID THE RINGMASTER\\" (Newspaper ad featuring Kahn's illustration). The New York Times. November 9, 1938. 'Ladies and Gentlemen' said the Ringmaster (1938), and two novels, To Meet Miss Long (1943) and Open House (1946), before embarking on her editorial career. Career Neither immediate nor by design, Kahn's career change was, in fact, incremental, circuitous, and, on Kahn's part, entirely unwitting. Her initial employment at Harper was as a manuscript reader, only later being recruited by Frederick Lewis Allen as an editor at Harper's Magazine, before finally being brought back by Harper & Brothers to help overhaul the publisher's antiquated mystery department. Even after these respective promotions, Kahn had no inkling that her current livelihood was soon to become her life's work.Nichols, Lewis. \\"American Notebook: Mystery Lady\\". The New York Times. April 28, 1968. Both her training and her aspirations at that time were primarily in the visual arts; aside from being a published author, Kahn was both a painter and a sculptor, as well as a stage and costume designer.\\"Joan Kahn, author of 'To Meet Miss Long'...\\" (captioned photo promoting Kahn's first novel). The Hartford Courant. February 28, 1943. As she would tell The New York Times in 1968, Kahn initially viewed the Harper job as merely a \\"temporary thing,\\" and never more so than when poring through roughly 200 previously rejected manuscripts, the reevaluation of which was one of the first tasks assigned the fledgling \\"Harper Novels of Suspense\\" team. However, when one of the handful she ended up accepting, The Horizontal Man by Helen Eustis, went on to win the Mystery Writers of America's annual Edgar Award for best first novel of 1947, Kahn quickly reconsidered. Her initial misgivings forgotten, Kahn aggressively pursued her newfound calling. Speaking with The Chicago Tribune in 1990, shortly after her retirement, she recalled: > I was so bloody lucky. Here I was, absolutely untrained and a dame. In those > days, women didn't get many jobs in publishing. I was a snotty little > girl... I was scared. I didn't know what I was doing. But I happened to be > working for very bright people, who gave me my head. They allowed me to > play. This freedom allowed Kahn to wield extraordinary power, purging Harper of the majority of its largely hidebound roster of mystery writers, sparing only John Dickson Carr and Nicholas Blake (aka C. Day Lewis).Blades, John. \\"Editors at the Scene of Crime's Path from Potboiler to a Gentler Genre\\". The Chicago Tribune. January 25, 1990. As an editor, Kahn was both devoted to her authors and extremely demanding ‚Äì by her own account, \\"a nasty editor.\\" She would not buy a book until it was fully fit to print; to that end, she worked long hours collaborating with her prospective authors. Moreover, no amount of previously successful collaborations between Kahn and a given author guaranteed publication of that author's next novel.Blades, John. \\"Editors at the Scene of Crime's Path from Potboiler to a Gentler Genre\\". The Chicago Tribune. January 25, 1990. Page 3 of 3 Appearing in The New York Times in November 1967, Anthony Boucher's enthusiastic review of the first of 11 suspense anthologies Kahn would produce over the following twenty years provides a concise summary of the previous twenty: > One of the best editors I know has never had her name on a book until this > season. You know the reliable quality of the \\"Harper Novels of Suspense,\\" > and the disproportionate frequency with which they turn up on my Best-of- > the-Year lists. Well, it is Joan Kahn who has, over the past two decades, > made the Harper imprint meaningful in suspense, who made us acquainted with > the giants of the modern English school (Julian Symons, Andrew Garve, > Michael Gilbert, etc.), who taught John Creasey and the American public how > to discover each other, who introduced probably the most important new > suspense writers of the 1960s (Nicolas Freeling and Dick Francis) - and if > her track record with American authors is less impressive, still John Ball, > Ed Lacy and Elizabeth Linington are not precisely negligible. In fact, few better examples could be found of Kahn's tough-love approach to editing than her 1965 collaboration with the then largely unknown John Ball; in coaxing from him the Edgar Award-winning In the Heat of the Night (itself the basis of the multi-award-winning film of the same name, starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger), Kahn's accomplishment, at least as perceived by critic and fellow editor Otto Penzler, was Svengali-like: > Ball, in spite of creating the iconic Virgil Tibbs, was an excruciatingly > bad writer, his prose more wooden than Sherwood Forest. He had a terrific > idea for a novel, assigning a black policeman down South to work with a > redneck sheriff, and sent it off to the greatest mystery editor who ever > lived, Joan Kahn.

The > New York Sun. August 16, 2006. Two of Kahn's key seventies signings, Tony Hillerman and Joseph Hansen, not only unleashed two hitherto frustrated novelists, but also introduced two groundbreaking American protagonists, Hillerman's Navajo Tribal Police Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn and Joseph Hansen's unapologetically gay insurance investigator Dave Brandstetter.Shenitz, Bruce. \\"Father Crime\\". Out. September 2003. Looking back in 1985, fifteen years after the fact, and again almost two decades later, Hansen recalls both the initial agonizing delay in publication and the ensuing mutual incredulity when Kahn finally came to the rescue: > But before there were reviews, there had to be a published book. And that > took some doing. It also took three years. Publishers were leery of my > matter-of-fact, non-apologetic approach to a subject that the rule book said > had to be treated sensationally or not at all.

St. James Press, 1985. . pp. 498. Cited in: * When Kahn, > magisterial mystery editor at Harper & Row, accepted this novel for > publication, she wrote my agent, \\"Where's this writer been hiding?\\" I had to > laugh to keep from crying. Hiding was the last thing I wanted to do... I'd > been writing for 46 years. Hillerman had an analogous tale to tell (a three-year travail, complete with Kahn cast as the deus ex machina), recounted shortly after his death by Jack Adrian in The Independent: > His first book, The Blessing Way (1970), took him three years to write and > then three months to rewrite after Joan Kahn, the mystery editor at > Harper's, sent him a detailed critique, telling him to \\"beef up\\" one of his > secondary characters. \\"Ironically,\\" Hillerman said, \\"that character was Joe > Leaphorn. I'd originally had a white anthropologist as the protagonist. I > owe my career to Joan Kahn.\\"Adrian, Jack. \\"Tony Hillerman: Writer who won > critical acclaim for his tales of Navajo crime fighters\\". The Independent. > October 30, 2008. The exact circumstances of Kahn's departure from Harper & Row in early 1980 remain unclear; contemporary press accounts offer no specifics. For her part, speaking with the Los Angeles Times in December of that year, Kahn suggests the move was her choice, a reluctant response to Harper's increasingly bottom- line orientation: > I left Harper with my heart breaking, but it was getting bigger and bigger. > Since the only thing I really give a damn about is the authors, and they > weren't being taken care of, I thought I'd better go and find a place that > would love them more. I think little places can afford to do that. However, in a 2011 obituary for editor Ruth Cavin, a recollection by Thomas McCormack (formerly Kahn's colleague at Harper, and later the CEO at St. Martin's Press, where Kahn would finish her career), is cited to the effect that, in 1980, Kahn, then 65, had simply been \\"retired\\" by her longtime employers.Shatzkin, Mike. \\"Ruth Cavin, great editor and world's nicest person, gone at 92\\".

The term particularly refers to the annual Rathajatra in Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal and other East Indian states, particularly the Odia festival that involve a public procession with a chariot with deities Jagannath (Vishnu avatar), Balabhadra (his brother), Subhadra (his sister) and Sudarshana Chakra (his weapon) on a ratha, a wooden deula- shaped chariot. It attracts over a million Hindu pilgrims who join the procession each year.Rathayatra processions have been historically common in Vishnu-related (Jagannath, Rama, Krishna) traditions in Hinduism across India, in Shiva-related traditions, saints and goddesses in Nepal, with Tirthankaras in Jainism, as well as tribal folk religions found in the eastern states of India. Notable ratha jatras in India include the Ratha jatra of Puri, the Dhamrai Ratha yatra and the Ratha yatra of Mahesh. Hindu communities outside India, such as in Singapore, celebrate Rathajatra such as those associated with Jagannath, Krishna, Shiva and Mariamman. According to Knut Jacobsen, a Rathajatra has religious origins and meaning, but the events have a major community heritage, social sharing and cultural significance to the organizers and participants.  Etymology  Ratha-jatra is derived two Sanskrit words, Ratha (‡§∞‡§•) which means chariot or carriage, and jƒÅtrƒÅ (‡¨Ø‡¨æ‡¨§‡≠ç‡¨∞‡¨æ) which means journey or pilgrimage. In other Indian languages such as Odia, the phonetic equivalents are used, such as ratha and yatra. Other names for the festival are ratha jatra or chariot festival. Description Ratha Yatra in Moscow Rathajatra is a journey in a chariot accompanied by the public. It typically refers to a procession (journey) of deities, people dressed like deities, or simply religious saints and political leaders. The term appears in medieval texts of India such as the Puranas, which mention the Rathajatra of Surya (Sun god), of Devi (Mother goddess), and of Vishnu. These chariot journeys have elaborate celebrations where the individuals or the deities come out of a temple accompanied by the public journeying with them through the Ksetra (region, streets) to another temple or to the river or the sea. Sometimes the festivities include returning to the sacrosanctum of the temple. Places Jagannath Puri Rath jatra in Odisha Rathajatra in Odisha, India. During the Jagannath Rath jatra, the triads are usually worshiped in the sanctum of the temple at Puri, but once during the month of Asadha (Rainy Season of Odisha, usually falling in month of June or July), they are brought out onto the Bada Danda (main street of Puri) and travel (3 km) to the Shri Gundicha Temple, in huge chariots (ratha), allowing the public to have dar≈õana (Holy view). This festival is known as Rath Jatra, meaning the journey (jatra) of the chariots (ratha). The Rathas are huge wheeled wooden structures, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately 45 feet high and 35 feet square and takes about 2 months to construct. The artists and painters of Puri decorate the chariots and paint flower petals and other designs on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses on the wall behind the throne. The huge chariots of Jagannath pulled during Rath Jatra is the etymological origin of the English word Juggernaut. The Ratha-Jatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha jatra. The most significant ritual associated with the Ratha- jatra is the chhera pahara. During the festival, the Gajapati King wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots in the Chera Pahara (sweeping with water) ritual. The Gajapati King cleanses the road before the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder with utmost devotion. As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannath. This ritual signified that under the lordship of Jagannath, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign Gajapati King and the most humble devotee. Chera pahara is held on two days, on the first day of the Ratha Jatra, when the deities are taken to garden house at Mausi Maa Temple and again on the last day of the festival, when the deities are ceremoniously brought back to the Shri Mandir. As per another ritual, when the deities are taken out from the Shri Mandir to the Chariots in Pahandi Vijay. In the Ratha Jatra, the three deities are taken from the Jagannath Temple in the chariots to the Gundicha Temple, where they stay for nine days. Thereafter, the deities again ride the chariots back to Shri Mandir in bahuda Jatra. On the way back, the three chariots halt at the Mausi Maa Temple and the deities are offered Poda Pitha, a kind of baked cake which are generally consumed by the people of Odisha. The observance of the Rath Jatra of Jagannath dates back to the period of the Puranas. Vivid descriptions of this festival are found in Brahma Purana, Padma Purana, and Skanda Purana. Kapila Samhita also refers to Rath Jatra. In Moghul period also, King Ramsingh of Jaipur, Rajasthan has been described as organizing the Rath Jatra in the 18th Century. In Odisha, Kings of Mayurbhanj and Parlakhemundi were organizing the Rath Jatra, though the most grand festival in terms of scale and popularity takes place at Puri. Moreover, Starza notes that the ruling Ganga dynasty instituted the Rath Jatra at the completion of the great temple around 1150 AD. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. Friar Odoric of Pordenone visited India in 1316‚Äì1318, some 20 years after Marco Polo had dictated the account of his travels while in a Genoese prison. In his own account of 1321, Odoric reported how the people put the \\"idols\\" on chariots, and the King and Queen and all the people drew them from the \\"church\\" with song and music. International Jagannath Ratha Jatra The Ratha Jatra festival has become a common sight in most major cities of the world since 1968 through the Hare Krishna movement. Local chapters put on the festival annually in over a hundred cities worldwide.Festival of India Dhamrai Jagannath Roth festival Dhamrai Jagannath Rath is a chariot temple, a Roth, dedicated to the Hindu God Jagannath located in Dhamrai, Bangladesh. The annual Jagannath Roth Jatra is a famous Hindu festival attracting thousands of people. The Roth Jatra in Dhamrai is one of the most important events for the Hindu community of Bangladesh. The original historical Roth was burnt down by the Pakistan Army in 1971 The Roth has since been rebuilt with Indian assistance.  Ratha Jatra of Mahesh The Ratha Yatra of Mahesh is the second oldest chariot festival in India (after Rath Yatra at Puri) and oldest in Bengal, having been celebrated since 1396 CE. It is a month-long festival held at Mahesh in Serampore of West Bengal and a grand fair is held at that time. People throng to have a share in pulling the long ropes (Roshi) attached to the chariots of Lord Jagannath, Balarama and Subhadra on the journey from the temple to Gundicha Bari (Masir bari) and back.  Manipur  The practice of Ratha Yatra in Manipur was introduced in the nineteenth century. The Khaki Ngamba chronicle mentions that on a Monday in either April or May 1829, the King of Manipur Gambhir Singh was passing through Sylhet whilst on a British expedition against the Khasis. Two processions were being prepared by Sylhet's Muslim and Hindu communities respectively. The Islamic month of Muharram in the history of Sylhet was a lively time during which tazia processions were common. This happened to fall on the same day as Ratha Yatra. Sensing possible communal violence, the Faujdar of Sylhet, Ganar Khan, requested the Hindu community to delay their festival by one day. Contrary to the Nawab's statement, a riot emerged between the two communities. As a Hindu himself, Singh managed to defend the Hindus and disperse the Muslim rioters with his Manipuri troops. The Ratha Yatra was not delayed, and Singh stayed to take part in it. Revered by the Hindu community as a defender of their faith, he enjoyed the procession and initiated the practice of celebrating Ratha Yatra and worshipping Jagannath in his own homeland of Manipur.

Restorative leadership is visionary, resolved, and creative in generating yet unfulfilled possibilities.Steffen, Seana. 2012. ‚ÄúBeyond Environmental Leadership to Restorative Leadership: An Emerging Framework for Cultivating Resilient Communities in the 21st Century.‚Äù In D.R. Gallagher (Ed.) Environmental Leadership: A Reference Handbook. (Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.) http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book234216 Restorative Leadership is a framework for empowering leadership that elevates the quality of life on Earth. It goes beyond dominant leadership ethics of the 20th Century and emphasizes the value and efficacy of community-based networks, place-based knowledge, as well as systemic and co-creative problem-solving to establish the conditions for global sustainability and collective well-being. History and Framework *Although restorative leadership practices have been used widely for millennia, the term restorative leadership was coined and defined by Dr. Seana Steffen in 2009. The concept was popularized by the Restorative Leadership Institute,http://www.restorative- leadership.org/Restorative_Leadership_Institute_Home.html an organization founded by Steffen in 2011. *Discerned from decades of fieldwork and a multi- year study of high impact leaders, the multidimensional and holistically integrated framework of restorative leadership includes the following distinctions: **A belief in the potential and power of community; **Participatory skills that empower self-organizing capacities and confidence while forwarding current priorities for collective well-being; **A substantive understanding of social-ecological interconnections that can be shared with and taught to others clearly and concisely; **An ability to engage individuals and communities in bridging that understanding of interconnection to a recognition of personal and collective rights and responsibilities in the web of relatedness. *The following assumptions underlie the restorative leadership framework: **The state of our world is a reflection of the quality of our leadership. **The world is in a state of overshoot and collapse. **Empowered action starts wherever we are and with whatever is in front of us, whether in an African village or a presidential office, by embodying the best of what is possible for life on Earth as we co-create our world. **Humanity is basically good and there is infinite potential to fulfill. *According to Steffen, the framework includes principles, practices and guiding questions. *Restorative leadership cultivates resilience. Principles and Practices Valuing and empowering community ‚Äì Restorative leadership utilizes a community-centered approach, engaging social networks to forward hopeful possibilities and leveraging communal assets to achieve goals. Traditional, indigenous and local knowledge is sought and valued. Holism and making connections ‚Äì Restorative leadership demonstrates an understanding of the interdependence and interconnectedness of life that can be articulated with great clarity, whether grounded in an intuitive sense or based in scientific knowledge. There is stewardship of personal, societal and global well-being. Rights, responsibilities and practicing participatory engagement ‚Äì Restorative leadership is distinct from command and control leadership by emphasizing mutuality and co-creation. It promotes self-organizing capacity, collective well-being, and resilience by facilitating, guiding and empowering. Social capital through engaging networks - With restorative leadership, connecting relationally and seeing connections holistically builds trust and familiarity across social networks. Engaging vertical and horizontal networks lays a foundation of social capital that translates to adaptive capacity in times of disaster or stress. Listening deeply and self-authorizing ‚Äì Being and living into the work involves listening deeply to oneself and others for innate intelligence and collective wisdom. Restorative leadership authorizes one‚Äôs own and community leadership to fulfill new possibilities. Holding the long view ‚Äì The relationship between daily life experience and broader environmental and social concerns becomes evident through restorative leadership practices. Sustainability and future generations are taken into account. Application and Lessons The following are some examples of high- impact leaders who demonstrate the principles and practices of restorative leadership transforming 21st century issues: #Janine Benyus #Bob Berkebile #Gro Harlem Brundtland #Wangari Maathai #Molly Melching #Elinor Ostrom #Meg Wheatley Other Restoratives #Restoration Ecology #Restorative Economy #Restorative Justice #Restorative Yoga #Restorative Practices #Restorative Justice See also #Servant Leadership #Transformational leadership #Janine Benyus #Gro Harlem Brundtland #Wangari Maathai #Molly Melching #Elinor Ostrom #Peter Senge #Meg Wheatley Notes  References  *Steffen, Seana. 2012. ‚ÄúBeyond Environmental Leadership to Restorative Leadership: An Emerging Framework for Cultivating Resilient Communities in the 21st Century.‚Äù In D.R.

This annual gathering provides a forum for the best minds in the small satellite community to review recent successes, explore new directions, and introduce emerging technologies in small spacecraft development. In addition to creating an excellent environment for networking and speaking with experts in military, science, and academic fields, the Conference offers a program of international relevance, focusing on the key challenges and opportunities facing the small satellite community today. History The first Small Satellite Conference was held in 1987 on the campus of Utah State University in Logan, Utah, USA and has remained there for each succeeding conference. In the beginning, small satellites were not widely accepted but have since become a vital part of the space industry. ‚ÄòSmall‚Äô is a relative term as mass continually decreases to create new types of small satellites. Though no standard for small satellites is accepted by all, it is generally assumed to include satellites up to 250 kg. In 1987 there were 50 to 100 attendees. In 2019 there were 3400 participants from over 40 countries that attended the week-long conference. Frank J. Redd Student Competition Named after Frank J. Redd, PhD, the founder of the Small Satellite Conference, the Student Competition provides undergraduate and graduate students pursuing a degree in an engineering or scientific discipline with the opportunity to share their work on small satellite concepts and missions. Each year, college students from across the globe compete for awards made possible through generous donations from organizations and individuals within the small satellite community. Awards are given to competition finalists presenting at the Small Satellite Conference. The number and dollar values of the awards are determined on a yearly basis.

But the references to early rock 'n' roll are undermined by Ono's vocal performance and by the lyrics. The lyrics express \\"female dread, fear and pain.\\" Ben Urish and Ken Bielen interpret the lyrics as reflecting the \\"physical and psychological effects of a nightmarish panic attack. Coates feels that Ono's projection of these emotions are enhanced by the continual repetition of the word \\"shake\\" and \\"shaking.\\" Ono restricts her vocal range and even when she nearly screams her words, Coates finds her voice to sound \\"oddly stifled.\\" Musicologist Tamara Levitx has suggested that this stifled vocal sound symbolizes the \\"suffocation of her female desire and voice\\" and more broadly women's invisibility within the world of rock 'n' roll even when they perform. Ono biographers Nell Beram & Carolyn Boriss-Krimsky consider the \\"Heartbeat Hotel\\" similarity to be a bit of a joke on Ono's part, playing off the fact that Presley's smooth, affected voice was almost the complete opposite of Ono's wild and spontaneous vocal style. Urish and Bielen concur that the song is intended as a parody on Presley's song. Reception Allmusic critic Ned Raggett describes \\"Midsummer New York\\" as \\"easygoing rock chug that won't surprise many\\". Gillian Gaar described it as a \\"rock 'n' roll parody/\\" Pitchfork critic Mark Masters described it as \\"spilling blues supporting Ono‚Äôs escalating screams.\\" Beatle biographer Bruce Pollock described it as \\"a relatively straight-ahead rocker.\\" Urish and Bielen see the song as evidence that Ono was learning rock techniques from husband John Lennon as well as she was learning the avant-garde techniques she was more famous for. Other appearances \\"Midsummer New York\\" was later included in Ono's compilation albums Onobox and Walking on Thin Ice. It was also used in Ono's musical New York Rock. An alternate version from the Fly recording sessions was released in 2018 as a bonus track on the Japanese Edition of Warzone. Ono performed \\"Midsummer New York\\" on the second day that she and Lennon co-hosted the Mike Douglas Show in 1972. She was accompanied by Elephant's Memory as well by Jerry Rubin and Barbara Loden playing bongo drums. This show was taped on 18 January 1972 and televised on 15 February. \\"Midsummer New York\\" was included on the original version of Lennon and Ono's 1972 television film Imagine but it was one of two Ono songs that was cut from the shortened revised version. \\"Mind Train,\\" the follow-up single from Fly, was the other song cut.

Several live versions have been released, including on Live Peace in Toronto 1969 and Some Time in New York City in 1972. An early version was titled \\"Mum's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow.\\" It has been covered by several other artists. Lyrics and music \\"Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\\" was inspired by Lennon's and Ono's custody fight with Ono's ex-husband Anthony Cox over Cox's and Ono's daughter Kyoko, representing Ono's attempt to communicate with her daughter. Ono and Kyoko were finally reunited in the 1990s when Kyoko was in her thirties. The lyrics of \\"Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\\" consist primarily of Ono wailing the phrase \\"Don't worry.\\" On the live version included on Live Peace in Toronto 1969 the phrase \\"mummy's only looking for her hand in the snow\\" is also included. The song is driven primarily by a blues-based guitar riff played by Lennon and Eric Clapton. John Blaney describes the riff as \\"hypnotic.\\" Authors Ken Bielen and Ben Urish write that Lennon and Clapton alternate between a \\"lilting semi- slide\\" groove and playing \\"sniping bites.\\" The other musicians on the studio version are Klaus Voorman on bass guitar and Ringo Starr on drums. According to Bielen and Urish, Starr's drumming variations ensure that the tension keeps mounting. John Lennon claimed that the song was \\"one of the fuckin' best rock 'n' roll records ever made.\\" Allmusic critic Ned Raggett describes Ono's vocal as a \\"screwy blues yowl,\\" claiming that it suggests \\"something off Led Zeppelin III gone utterly berserk.\\" New York Times critic Allan Kozinn compares Ono's vocal to \\"a wailing, overdriven electric guitar,\\" claiming its virtuosity compares with the actual electric guitar playing of Lennon and Clapton. Rolling Stone Magazine contributor John Lewis describes it as a \\"mournful caterwaul of despair.\\" The earliest recorded version of the song, titled \\"Mum's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow\\" was sung by Ono at Queen Charlotte's Hospital while she was being observed during her pregnancy with Lennon's child, a pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. Lennon provides the sole accompaniment on acoustic guitar. This version was originally released by Aspen magazine and was later included as a bonus track on the CD reissue of the couple's Wedding Album. The studio version released as a single and on Fly was recorded on October 3, 1969 at Lansdowne Studios in London. The single has the words \\"PLAY LOUD\\" written on the label, as does \\"Cold Turkey\\" on the other side. Live versions The version of \\"Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\\" included on Live Peace in Toronto 1969 was recorded at Varsity Stadium in Toronto, Canada on September 13, 1969. The Plastic Ono Band for that performance was assembled on short notice and included Ono, Lennon, Clapton, Voorman and Alan White on drums. After Lennon played some of his recent songs and rock 'n' roll classics, Ono sang a two- song set consisting of \\"Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\\" followed by \\"John John (Let's Hope for Peace).\\" Audience reaction to her set was muted, and some booing was reported, more directed at \\"John John\\" than \\"Don't Worry Kyoko.\\" John Blaney explains that the audience \\"had come to listen to good ol' rock 'n' roll, not a Japanese woman screaming at the top of her voice,\\" but \\"one could at least get into the groove of 'Don't Worry Kyoko.'\\" Chip Madinger and Mark Easter claim that despite the audience's cold reception, the band \\"did an admirable job\\" backing Ono on the song. Ken Bielen and Ben Urish claim that the audience may have been startled by \\"Ono's full-throttle vocals and Lennon and Clapton's hard core guitar sounds. The version on Some Time in New York City was recorded at the Lyceum Ballroom in London on December 15, 1969 at the \\"Peace for Christmas\\" Concert for UNICEF. In addition to the musicians who performed in Toronto, Billy Preston played keyboards, George Harrison played guitar, Keith Moon joined in on drums towards the end, and members of Delaney & Bonnie & Friends also performed. This version apparently lasted 40 minutes, as the musicians became \\"locked in the hypnotic riff,\\" and was edited down to 15 minutes for the album release. Drummer Alan White recalls finally bringing the song to its conclusion by speeding up to the point where the other musicians couldn't keep up, and then slowing the tempo down, allowing the song to end. Lennon claimed that the musicians on this version were \\"inspired out of their skulls\\" and that it was \\"the most fantastic music [he'd] ever heard.\\" Bielen and Urish describe this performance as \\"vibrant\\", enhanced by the call and response between Ono's vocal and the horn section, and claim that the finale was so \\"hyped-up\\" that even Ono had trouble keeping up. Lennon biographer Geoffery Giuliano and Moon biographer Tony Fletcher claim that half the audience walked out during the performance. The Lennons played the song, backed by Jim Keltner on drums and Elephant's Memory, at the matinee performance of the One to One benefit concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City on August 30, 1972. These were the performances that were released as the Live in New York City album and video. However, \\"Don't Worry Kyoko\\" was not performed for the evening concert and was not included on either the album or video versions of Live in New York City. In September 2005, Ono performed the song as an encore to her performance at ArthurFest. Ono's and Lennon's son Sean Lennon led the band for that performance.

The book was praised by commentators, who credited Lukes with showing the paradoxes inherent within Marxist approaches to morality. It has been called a classic introduction. Reception Marxism and Morality has been described as a classic introduction to its subject by the political theorist Terrell Carver. The book received positive reviews from Michael Perelman in the Southern Economic Journal and Alan Swingewood in the British Journal of Sociology. The book was also reviewed by the philosopher Arthur Danto in The Times Literary Supplement, Michael Donnelly in the American Journal of Sociology, and May Ellen Batiuk in Humanity & Society, and discussed by David Bankhurst in Praxis International. Perelman described the book as \\"a work of disarming simplicity that brings together much of the far reaching literature on the subject of marxism and morality.\\" He credited Lukes with \\"bringing both scholarship and intelligence to his subject matter\\", finding Lukes's discussion of the wage/labor relationship especially successful. He disagreed with Lukes that the philosopher Karl Marx underestimated the importance of values such as freedom of the press, writing that \\"the effective use of such freedom rarely extended beyond the privileged strata of society\\", and criticized Lukes for neglecting Marx's insight that capitalists and workers both behave through \\"character masks.\\" He concluded that, \\"Despite its shortcomings, Lukes offers us a useful, though idiosyncratic vision of Marx's theory of morality.\\" Swingewood described the book as \\"a notable contribution to current debates on the problems of socialist ethics and moral theory\\". He credited Lukes with offering \\"a concise and cogently argued analysis of the many paradoxes within Marxism on ethics and moral theory.\\" He called Lukes's chapter on the \\"means-ends debate\\" \\"brilliant\\", writing that Lukes showed how \\"the possibility of alternative means (and thus the need to argue for them outside the framework of historical necessity) was largely ignored.\\" He concluded that, \\"Lukes's book is an important contribution to the contemporary debate on the renewal of democratic socialism.\\" Bankhurst praised Lukes for his \\"honesty and responsibility\\" in confronting the issue of whether Marxism suffers from a \\"deep-rooted theoretical incoherence\\" that accounts for its \\"terrible record\\" in political life, commenting that, \\"In the realm of morality\\" Marx's thought \\"does seem to abound in paradoxes and peculiarities.\\" He credited Lukes with correctly characterizing Marx's basic outlook on morality as an analysis of it \\"as an expression of class struggle\\" combined with \\"the dismissal of the prevailing moral orthodoxy as the embodiment of the interests of the dominant class.\\" References Bibliography ;Books * ;Journals  * Category:1985 non-fiction books Category:Books about Marxism Category:Books by Steven Lukes Category:Contemporary philosophical literature Category:English-language books Category:Ethics books Category:Morality Category:Oxford University Press books ","title":"Marxism and Morality"},{"id":"37985884","text":"Softaculous is a commercial script library that automates the installation of commercial and open source web applications to a website.

Biography When Shachne was 13 years of age he began to receive religious training in the Mordechai Rosenblatt Talmud Torah while also attending public school on the East Side of Manhattan. His father was very busy with his cap business, and so he entrusted Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Herman with the religious upbringing of young Shachna. Rabbi Herman eventually convinced the lad to study at the Yeshiva in New Haven, Connecticut where a young Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg also studied at Rabbi Herman's behest. In his youth, he briefly studied Talmud in Yeshiva University and before traveling to Europe to study under Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz in the Yeshiva in Kaminetz and then in Mir Yeshiva. While in Europe, he married Liba Gulevsky. Before returning to America, Rabbi Zohn developed a close student relationship with the Jewish rabbinical leader of the time, Rabbi Israel Meir Kagan. Upon returning to America in anticipation of the Holocaust, he assumed a position in Torah Vodaas (in Brooklyn as a professor of Talmud, eventually becoming one of the school's deans. Eventually, Rabbi Zohn retired from his position in Torah Vodaas to immigrate to Israel. There, Rabbi Schachne Zohn headed for forty years a study group for adult men in Jerusalem which analyzed sacrificial laws in a Talmudic context. He lived in the Ezrat Torah neighborhood of Jerusalem. In the summer of 2008, Rabbi Shachna Zohn reported that he saw his former teacher Rabbi Israel Meir Kagan (with whom he studied Torah in pre-Holocaust Europe) in a dream and was told that the Geulah (Hebrew for Redemption) is imminent. This fact was publicized by Rabbi Tzvi Mayer Zilberberg and was later confirmed by Mishpacha Magazine. Rabbi Zohn died on December 20, 2012.

It was also released as a single, backed by \\"Yang Yang\\". It has also been covered by a number of artists, including Boy George, Hermine Demoriane and Porcupine Tree. Description \\"Death of Samantha\\" is sung by Ono, with her husband John Lennon playing rhythm guitar and Elephant's Memory providing additional musical backing. Author Gillian Gaar has called the song a \\"moving portrayal\\" of a woman who has \\"repressed all feelings for the sake of outward appearance\\". Steven Mirkin of the Orange County Register describes the song as \\"slow twisty blues\\". Jon Pareles of the New York Times calls the song \\"elegiac\\". Ono biographer Jerry Hopkins calls it \\"depressing\\". Author Bruce Pollock claims that in the song, Ono \\"sounds eerily like Kate Bush\\". Ono's son Sean Lennon claims that the song was inspired by an incident that occurred on election night in 1972. That night, Richard Nixon, whose administration had Lennon under surveillance and wanted Lennon deported, was re-elected as President of the United States. Lennon got drunk at a party and fondled another woman's breasts. Sean has stated that the song \\"was all about dad having sex with some girl at a party where my mom was\\". Ono has said that the song flashed to her in the studio, remembering \\"something terribly upsetting\\" that had happened to her, and was feeling like she was \\"really sad\\". Ono has stated that when she wrote the song she \\"sort of saw this graveyard\\", explaining that it was not exactly a graveyard because there weren't many gravestones, but rather a gray day with \\"gray people standing around like somebody has died\\". After John Lennon's death, many fans found the lyrics of \\"Death of Samantha\\" descriptive of the vigil for Lennon. Ono has said that at the time \\"many fans sent me the 'Death of Samantha' lyrics saying that it was uncanny that the lyrics seemed to be describing the vigil. They said, 'You were talking about now.' It was very sad but in a way it was kind of spot-on.\\" In addition to its appearance on Approximately Infinite Universe, \\"Death of Samantha\\" has appeared on a number of Ono's compilation albums, including Onobox and Walking on Thin Ice. Other versions Porcupine Tree covered \\"Death of Samantha\\" on the 2007 collaboration album Yes, I'm a Witch, performing with Ono's vocals. James Hunter of SPIN Magazine describes their version as \\"gothlike.\\" Robert Sandall of The Telegraph remarks on the contrast between Ono's \\"gravely tremulous vocal\\" and the acoustic guitar backing, which he describes as \\"a stark approach which lends her the air of a Leonard Cohen impersonator\\". Amy Longsdorf of The Spokesman-Review calls it one of the best songs on Yes, I'm a Witch, claiming it has a \\"silvery spaciousness\\" to it, describing the song as \\"aching\\". Hermine Demoriane covered the song on her 1984 album Lonely at the Top. AllMusic critic Ned Raggett calls this version \\"an inspired nod to an equally unique artist\\". A cover by Boy George has been released on his 2013 album This Is What I Do. A dub version, featuring Sinead O'Connor, can be found on the online-only release of \\"This Is What I Dub\\".

Yarmouk is a district of Damascus that is home to the biggest community of Palestinian refugees in Syria. The fighting was between the Syrian Army and PFLP-GC on one side, and Syrian rebels on the other. The rebels included the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and a group made up of Palestinians, called Liwa al-Asifa or Storm Brigade. On 17 December, it was reported that the FSA and anti-Assad Palestinians had taken control of the camp. The FSA and Syrian Army agreed to leave Yarmouk as a neutral, demilitarized zone, but sporadic clashes continued. Background At the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ‚Äì General Command (PFLP-GC) was based in Yarmouk and supported Syria's Ba'ath Party government led by the Al-Assad family. At the beginning of the war, tensions arose in Yarmouk between the PFLP-GC and anti- Assad Palestinian residents. On 5 June 2011, a number of Yarmouk residents were shot dead while protesting at the Israeli border. Allegedly angered by the PFLP-GC's refusal to take part in the protests, thousands of mourners burnt-down its headquarters in Yarmouk. PFLP-GC members opened-fire on the crowd, killing 14 Palestinians and wounding 43.\\"Report: 14 Palestinians killed in Syria camp\\" . Ma'an News Agency, 8 June 2011.

On 3 August 2012, Al Arabiya reported that over 21 civilians were killed when the Syrian Army shelled Yarmouk.\\"At least 21 killed in shelling on Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Syria: NGO\\" . Al Arabiya, 3 August 2012. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas condemned the Syrian Army for shelling the camp and chided the PFLP-GC for dragging Palestinians into the conflict. On 31 October, the FSA announced that they had helped form a brigade made up of anti-Assad Palestinians, called Liwa al-Asifa (Storm Brigade), who have been armed to take control of Yarmouk. The PFLP-GC leader Ahmed Jibril and his men were accused of harassing Yarmouk's residents and attacking FSA fighters. Many Palestinian men from the camp also joined other FSA units and fought with them in the Damascus districts of Tadamon and Al-Hajar Al-Aswad. December clashes Fierce fighting in Yarmouk began on 5 December 2012 and lasted until 17 December. The fighting mainly involved the FSA (along with the Liwa al- Asifa brigade) fighting against the PLFP-GC. On 16 December, Syrian Army jets bombed Yarmouk, for the first time since the civil war began. Activists reported that a school and mosque sheltering refugees were hit. It was reported that at least 23 were killed, all civilians. About 1,000 Palestinians reached Lebanon less than 48 hours after the bombing. The new arrivals said they were now openly hostile towards the Syrian government that had long portrayed itself as the protector of Palestinians in Syria.The Guardian 18 December 2012 Palestinians flee to Lebanon after jet bombs Syria's largest refugee camp Iran's Fars News said that \\"terrorist\\" rebels had entered Yarmouk and shot dead \\"dozens of Palestinians and Syrian civilians\\". On 17 December, it was claimed that many PFLP-GC fighters defected to the rebels. One PFLP-GC commander said \\"I felt that we became soldiers for the Assad regime, not guards for the camps, so I decided to defect\\". He claimed that government forces stood by and watched as the PFLP-GC fought the rebels, without helping the Palestinians. Ahmed Jibril reportedly fled Damascus for the Mediterranean city of Tartous. PFLP-GC political bureau member Hussam Arafat, however, announced that Jibril was still in Damascus and that only a small number of fighters had defected. That day, rebel forces gained full control of Yarmouk as well as another Palestinian camp, with help from anti-Assad Palestinians, pushing out the pro-government PFLP-GC fighters. The pro-government PFLP-GC fighters were reportedly overwhelmed and suffered great losses as they were unable to evacuate their wounded due to rebel snipers on the roofs. Government forces had surrounded the camp, however, as many refugees fled. On 20 December, the FSA said it had pushed all pro-government fighters out of Yarmouk and handed it back to the Palestinians. The day before, fresh fighting on the outskirts of Yarmouk killed a civilian and four PFLP-GC members. Shortly after, government and rebel representatives agreed that all armed groups should withdraw from Yarmouk and leave it as a neutral zone. The agreement also said that the PFLP-GC should be dismantled and its weapons surrendered. However, a spokesman for the pro-rebel Palestine Refugee Camp Network said, \\"the implementation of the truce has been problematic\\" because of \\"intermittent\\" government shelling of Yarmouk and clashes on its outskirts.\\"Syrian fight now 'overtly sectarian,' U.N. says\\". CNN, 20 December 2012. An AFP reporter at Batikha, the main entrance to the camp, reported sporadic shooting on 21 December but no gunmen were seen on the streets of Yarmouk.

Al-Monitor, 27 December 2012. One PFLP official said \\"Everyone knows the true size of PFLP-GC. They are not representative of the Palestinians\\". Another said that Jibril \\"does not even belong to the Palestinian Left. He is closer to the extremist right-wing groups than to revolutionary leftist ones\\". On 18 December, the Palestinian National Council (PNC) denounced Jibril, saying it would expel him over his role in the conflict.\\"Ahmad Jibril to be expelled from the PLO\\" . Al Akhbar (Lebanon), 18 December 2012. On 25 December there was reportedly fighting in or around Yarmouk between rebels and the pro-government Jaysh al-Sha'bi (or Popular Committees). On 28 December, Iranian Press TV reported further clashes in Yarmouk. The UNRWA reported that 12 people were killed and 20 wounded during fighting in Yarmouk on 17 January 2013. By January 2014, FSA and Liwa al-Asifa controlled 75% of the refugee camp, while the other 25% was controlled by the Syrian Army and the PFLP-GC.Damascus: Yarmouk Starves as Relief Convoys Attacked Al Akhbar, 13 January 2014 The situation had become desperate. \\"The regime forces won't remove the siege on the camp as long as the militants are staying in it\\" a pro-Assad Palestinian official, Husam Arafat said.

History Altrossgarten Church, ca. 1906 The parishioners in the Rossgarten quarter originally belonged to L√∂benicht Church.B√∂tticher, p. 133 They were then allowed to build a small wooden chapel on Predigerstra√üe, which was dedicated in 1623 and completed the following year. The first pastor was the hymnist Georg Weissel from Domnau (1590-1635), previously pastor in Friedland.Gause, p. 413 Although this church was originally known as the Rossgarten Church (Ro√üg√§rter Kirche), its name was changed to Altro√üg√§rter Kirche (Old Rossgarten Church) to differentiate it from Neurossgarten Church built in Neurossgarten in the 1640s.Boetticher, p. 134 Because of the increasing population of Rossgarten, a replacement brick church was built around the chapel by the initiative for Weissel's successor, Pastor Georg Falck (1625-1720). Construction began in 1651 and its dedication occurred in 1683; the prior wooden chapel was dismantled from 1683-84. The new church's steeple with tented roof dated to 1693. Sights of Altrossgarten Church included its high altar from 1677, Baroque baptismal chamber, and a confessional with columns by Isaak Riga the Younger from 1692. The church's organ with two caryatids was designed by Adam Gottlob Casparini. The chamber tomb on the northern side had a beautiful wrought iron door designed by the locksmith Johann Michael Sommer in 1712.Albinus, p. 19 The church was restored in 1923. Pastors of the church included Kons.-Rat B. Ankermann, Paul Kuessner, W. Pensky, Lic. Erich Leidreiter, and Erich Lackner. Altrossgarten Church was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg and 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg, with its ruins demolished by the Soviet administration in Kaliningrad in 1968. A silver-gilt chalice from the church is now in the Berlin archives of the Evangelical Church in Germany.

According to John Lennon's biographer Peter Doggett, the lyrics of \\"Now or Never\\" sum up Ono's philosophy that \\"Dream you dream alone is just a dream/But dream we dream together is reality.\\" New York Times music critic Stephen Holden described this line as expressing a \\"Beatles-style utopianism.\\" A Yoko Ono press release described the song as a \\"wistful wake-up call to a tuned-out, slacked-off America.\\" Vietnam War historian Lee Andresen considered the song to be a protest against the war. The notorious cover of the single release, which depicted dead Vietnamese victims of the My Lai Massacre reinforced the Vietnam connection. Andresen describes the cover as being \\"the most painfully graphic of any produced by record companies during the war.\\" Ben Urish and Ken Bielen describe the lyrics as being \\"interrogative.\\" Rolling Stone reviewer Nick Tosches was underwhelmed by the lyrics, using lines such as \\"People of America/When will we stop/It is now or never\\" as examples of the \\"obnoxiousness\\" of Ono's lyrics at the time, describing them as \\"philosophical and political party-line corn that went out of style with last season's prime- time TV.\\" The music of \\"Now or Never\\" is folk music-like in the vein of early Bob Dylan. It was recorded in February and March 1972 at the Record Plant East in New York. John Lennon played guitar and Elephant's Memory provided the other backing instrumentation. Ono and Lennon co-produced the recording. Lennon and Ono rehearsed \\"Now or Never\\" for their One on One concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York in August 1972, prior to any official release of the song, but the song was ultimately not performed in the actual concerts. The couple did perform the song at their TV appearance for the Jerry Lewis Telethon a few days later on September 4, 1972. \\"Now or Never\\" was the second of three songs they played at the telethon, after \\"Imagine\\" and before \\"Give Peace a Chance.\\" At the time Lennon was under threat of deportation from the United States, and Ono introduced the song by stating that ‚ÄúJohn and I love this country very much and we‚Äôre very happy that we‚Äôre still here.‚Äù The telethon would prove to be the couple's last performances with Elephant's Memory. In 1984 a revised version of \\"Now or Never\\" was released on the album Every Man Has a Woman celebrating Ono's 50th birthday. This version used a children's choir to provide the vocals. According to Urich and Bielen, this added urgency to the lyrics, \\"as if a very aware child were chastising the adults for what they were permitting the world to become.\\" The instrumentation was from the original 1972 sessions, including Lennon and Elephant's Memory. In 1994 the song was included in Ono's Off-Broadway musical New York Rock.

It is more commonly referred to by its web address JCDA.ca, owing to its evolution into a print and electronic based knowledge network. History Published dental literature in Canada was first produced by Dr. W.H. Elliot of Montreal, PQ who published 18 papers in the American Dental Journal starting in 1842. In the 1850s there were several attempts to create a Canadian dental journal (the Family Dentist from Brockville and Journal of the Times from Halifax) but none lasted very long. In 1868, Dr. W. George Beers of Montreal (\\"the father of lacross\\") published the Canadian Journal of Dental Science. Dr. Beers later moved to Hamilton, Ontario where he recruited Dr. Curtis Chittenden (a founder of the Ontario Dental Association) as an associate editor. The journal struggled and eventually failed in 1879. Dr. Beers, returned to Montreal where, in 1889, he launched the Dominion Dental Journal 10 years after the failure of his previous journal. The Dominion Dental Journal became Canada's preeminent dental journal and persisted for more than 46 years. In 1935, it was absorbed by the newly created Journal of the Canadian Dental Association and joined with La Revue dentaire canadienne, a French language dental journal that had been founded in 1915 under the editorship of Honor√© Thibault. JCDA has been published since that time in both English and French. The modern journal The modern JCDA has transformed into a network of knowledge delivery vehicles. The printed journal still exists but it is one piece of a system that includes the JCDA.ca website, the JCDA Clinical Q&A; blogs, the JCDA Oasis mobile platform and social media bulletins through email (JCDA Express and JCDA Bulletin), Twitter (JCDATweets & JCDAClinicalQA), Facebook and LinkedIn. Impact In the 2012 Journal Citation Reports, JCDA had an impact factor of 0.624. JCDA is indexed in Medline, Journal Citation Reports and Science Citation Index. Publication Model JCDA has a continuous publication model, where articles are published to JCDA.ca before, or in place, of being published in the printed journal. The printed journal is distributed to all dentists and dental students in Canada as well some colleagues outside of Canada. Major Delivery Networks Core Sections of JCDA (print & web) JCDA has three core sections of material. Research; A scholarly section of publications that has been peer-reviewed by at least 2 external examiners and consists of information that is novel to the dental literature. Clinical Dentistry; A clinically focused section in user friendly formats such as case reports, \\"point-of-care\\" and diagnostic challenges. Some of the material will be peer-reviewed while others will be informative/opinion pieces. News & Issues; A section dedicated to the news and issues from the Canadian Dental Association and/or the provincial dental societies. JCDA Oasis JCDA Oasis was launched in 2011 to create an area for collaboratively edited content, in the Web 2.0 spirit, where rapid publication, dissemination and open dialogue between contributors and readers are pillars of process. JCDA involves organizations (e.g. Organization for Safety, Asepsis and Prevention), industry partners and dentists (e.g. Coronation Dental Specialty Group) to create content then it is opened to discussion with readers. There are three core sections. Oasis Discussions; Launched in 2012, Oasis Discussions (previously named Clinical Q&A;) is an open forum for discussion of clinical cases, in a blog format with multi-media presentations. Oasis Discussions is hosted at OasisDiscussions.ca. Each week, volunteer specialists from across Canada* & the US post open ended questions and research on case management and \\"hot\\" topics, the goal of which is to foster lively discussions between professionals. Oasis Mobile; A resource created through a collaborative effort of dentists and other professionals from across Canada to offer an \\"Online Advice and Searchable Information System\\"; OASIS. The site offers concise clinical information and decision supports for everyday practice. The broad categories of information are medical conditions, prescription drugs and dental & medical emergencies Case Conferences; Webinar discussions of specific clinical cases. Other Sections JCDA also features classified ads for dentists in Canada as well as a products and services section where industry can display their products.

It resulted in guilty verdicts and death sentences for former Romanian President and Romanian Communist Party General Secretary, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, and his wife, Elena Ceau»ôescu. The main charge was genocide‚Äînamely, murdering \\"over 60,000 people\\" during the revolution in Timi»ôoara. Other sources put the death toll between 689 and 1,200. Nevertheless, the charges did not affect the trial. General Victor StƒÉnculescu had brought with him a specially selected team of paratroopers from a crack regiment, handpicked earlier in the morning to act as a firing squad. Before the legal proceedings began, StƒÉnculescu had already selected the spot where the execution would take place‚Äîalong one side of the wall in the barracks' square. Nicolae Ceau»ôescu refused to recognize the tribunal, arguing its lack of constitutional basis and claiming that the revolutionary authorities were part of a Soviet plot. Arrest On 22 December, during the Romanian Revolution, Nicolae and Elena Ceau»ôescu left the Central Committee building in Bucharest by helicopter toward Snagov, from which they left soon after towards Pite»ôti.Burakovski, p.272 The helicopter pilot claimed to be in danger of anti-aircraft fire, so he landed on the Bucharest‚ÄìT√¢rgovi»ôte road, near GƒÉe»ôti. They stopped a car driven by Dr. Nicolae DecƒÉ, who took them to VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti, after which he informed the local authorities that the Ceau»ôescus were going toward T√¢rgovi»ôte. The Ceau»ôescus took another car and told its driver, Nicolae Petri»ôor, to drive them to T√¢rgovi»ôte. During the trip, the Ceau»ôescus heard news of the revolution on the car radio (by then the revolutionaries had taken control of the state media), causing Ceau»ôescu to angrily denounce the revolution as a coup d'√©tat. Petri»ôor took the couple to an agricultural center near T√¢rgovi»ôte, where they were locked in an office and were later arrested by soldiers from a local army garrison.Burakovski, p. 273 Creation of the tribunal As the new authorities heard the news of their apprehension from General Andrei Kemenici, the commander of the army unit, they began to discuss what to do with the Ceau»ôescus. Victor StƒÉnculescu, who was Ceau»ôescu's last defence minister before going over to the revolution, wanted a quick execution, as did Gelu Voican Voiculescu. Ion Iliescu, Romania's provisional president, supported holding a trial first. During the evening of 24 December, StƒÉnculescu sent the secret code \\"recourse to the method\\" to Kemenici, referring to the execution of the Ceau»ôescus. A ten-member tribunal was formed to try the case. The members of the panel were all military judges. Charges The charges were published in Monitorul Oficial the day after the execution:Monitorul Oficial, Anul I, Nr. 3, December 26, 1989 * Genocide ‚Äì over 60,000 victims * Subversion of state power by organizing armed actions against the people and state power. * Offense of destruction of public property by destroying and damaging buildings, explosions in cities, etc. * Undermining the national economy. * Trying to flee the country using funds of over $1 billion deposited in foreign banks. Counsel for the defense The morning of the trial, prominent lawyer Nicu Teodorescu was having Christmas breakfast with his family when he was telephoned by an aide to Iliescu, and asked by the National Salvation Front to be the Ceau»ôescus' defense counsel. He replied that it would be \\"an interesting challenge\\". Teodorescu met the couple for the first time in the T√¢rgovi»ôte \\"court room\\", when he was given ten minutes to consult with his clients. With so little time to prepare any defense, he tried to explain to them that their best hope of avoiding the death sentence was to plead insanity. The Ceau»ôescus brushed away the idea; according to Teodorescu, \\"When [he] suggested it, Elena in particular said it was an outrageous set-up. They felt deeply insulted. ... They rejected [his] help after that.\\" Trial The trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceau»ôescu was very brief, lasting approximately one hour. Ceau»ôescu defended himself by arguing that the tribunal was against the 1965 Constitution of Romania and that only the Great National Assembly had the power to depose him. He argued that it was a coup d'√©tat organized by the Soviets. Nicolae and Elena Ceau»ôescu were convicted on all charges and condemned to death in a show trial. At one point, their forcibly-assigned lawyers abandoned their clients' defense and joined with the prosecutor, accusing them of capital crimes instead of defending them.:s:ro:Stenograma procesului Ceau»ôescu, translated at :s:Transcript of the closed trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceau»ôescu. No offer of proof was made for the Ceau»ôescus' alleged crimes. They were tried based on references, solely by offense-name or hearsay, to criminal acts they had committed in the opinion of prosecutors, or as alleged in press reports. Various irregularities presented themselves, or became apparent post-trial: * The trial was held immediately, without a prior criminal investigation. * The suspects were not examined psychiatrically, which was mandatory by law. * The suspects could not choose their lawyers. * An accusation of genocide was never proven. Four top Ceau»ôescu aides later admitted complicity in genocide in 1990. Pro TV stated that there were 860 people killed after 22 December 1989 (i.e. when the dictatorial couple was no longer in charge). 0:32:39 Another source gives the figure of 306 people killed 17-22 December 1989.Valentin Marin. Martirii Revolu»õiei √Æn date statistice Editura Institului Revolu»õiei Rom√¢ne, Bucharest, 2010, p. 22 * The court did not bother to find and prove the truth. There was no file of evidence presented to the court. * The Ceau»ôescus were accused of having US$1 billion in foreign bank accounts. No such accounts have ever been found. * Nicolae Ceau»ôescu openly disavowed the court. One of the Ceau»ôescus' lawyers suggested before the execution that since the pair did not recognize the tribunal, there was no avenue for appealing the verdict. * The judges' verdict allowed for appealing to a higher court. The Ceau»ôescus were executed a few minutes after the verdict, rendering that provision moot. * The person who signed the decree for organizing the court, coup leader Ion Iliescu, lacked legal power to do so. The order was handwritten in a lavatory in the Romanian Ministry of Defence.»öene, Ionu»õ Cine a ordonat execu≈£ia lui Nicolae Ceau»ôescu? Napocanews.ro * Romanian law prohibited carrying out the death sentence less than ten days after a verdict to allow time by the defendant's lawyers to file an appeal.BBC Days That Shook the World Season 3, Episode 8, \\"The Road To Revolution: The Execution of Ceau»ôescu/The Iranian Revolution\\" After the Ceau»ôescus' execution, the death penalty was abolished in Romania. * The coup leaders said the execution of the Ceau»ôescus was necessary to stop terrorists from attacking the new political order. No terrorists or terrorist cells were found to have been active in Romania.R.M. Dan Voinea: Nu au existat teroristi in decembrie '89. Sotii Ceausescu au fost ucisi pentru a salva administratia comunista, care dureaza si azi Hotnews.ro A newer insight of prosecution of \\"crimes against humanity\\" claims that the new regime orchestrated \\"a psychosis of terrorism\\" through diversionary actions. * Initially Iliescu did not wish to carry out the executions immediately, and he instead favored a formal trial to be carried out several weeks later. General Victor StƒÉnculescu insisted on the couple's hasty execution as an imperative for the Romanian Army supporting the newly created National Salvation Front. After a few hours of debating this option, Iliescu agreed with StƒÉnculescu and signed the decree for organizing the court. Execution Before the execution, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu declared, \\"We could have been shot without having this masquerade!\\" Just after the trial, the Ceau»ôescus were executed at 4:00 p.m. local time at a military base outside Bucharest on 25 December 1989. The execution was carried out by a firing squad consisting of paratroop regiment soldiers: Captain Ionel Boeru, Sergeant-Major Georghin Octavian and Dorin-Marian Cirlan, while reportedly hundreds of others also volunteered. The Ceau»ôescus' hands were tied by four soldiers before the execution. Popular history author Simon Sebag Montefiore has claimed that, before the sentences were carried out, Elena Ceau»ôescu screamed, \\"You sons of bitches!\\" while being led outside and lined up against the wall; at the same time Nicolae Ceau»ôescu sang \\"The Internationale\\". The firing squad began shooting as soon as the two were in position against a wall. The execution happened too quickly for the television crew assigned to the trial and death sentence to videotape it in full; only the last round of shots was filmed. In 2014, the by then retired Captain Boeru told a reporter for The Guardian newspaper that he believes that the shots he fired from his rifle were solely responsible for the deaths of both of the Ceau»ôescus, because, of the three soldiers in the firing squad, he was the only one who remembered to switch his Kalashnikov rifle to fire fully automatic, and at least one member of the group hesitated to shoot for several seconds. In 1990, a member of the National Salvation Front reported that 120 bullets were found in the couple's bodies. In 1989, Prime Minister Petre Roman told French television that the execution was carried out quickly due to rumors that loyalists would rescue the couple. Burial After the execution, the bodies were covered with canvas. The Ceau»ôescus' corpses were flown to Bucharest and buried five days later in Ghencea Cemetery on 30 December 1989. The bodies were exhumed for identification and reburied in 2010. Groups of elderly Ceau»ôescus' supporters visit to place flowers on the grave, with large numbers of pensioners gathering on 26 January, Ceau»ôescus's birthday. Release of the images The hasty trial and the images of the dead Ceau»ôescus were videotaped and the footage promptly released in numerous Western countries two days after the execution. Later that day, it was also shown on Romanian television. Reactions Valentin Ceau»ôescu, elder son of the Ceau»ôescus, argued in 2009 that the revolutionary forces should have killed his parents when they had arrested them on 22 December since they did not need any trial. After making vague comments about the incident, Ion Iliescu stated that it was \\"quite shameful, but necessary\\". In a similar vein, StƒÉnculescu told the BBC in 2009 that the trial was \\"not just, but it was necessary\\" because the alternative would have been seeing Nicolae lynched on the streets of Bucharest. Several countries criticized the new rulers of Romania after the execution due to lack of public trial. The United States was the most prominent critic of the trial, stating: \\"We regret the trial did not take place in an open and public fashion.\\" Aftermath In December 2018, Iliescu, former Deputy Prime Minister Gelu Voican Voiculescu, former Romanian Air Force chief Iosif Rus, and former National Salvation Front council member Emil Dumitrescu were indicted by Romanian military prosecutors for crimes against humanity for the deaths that occurred during the Romanian Revolution, most of which took place after Ceau»ôescu was overthrown. The indictment also made reference to the conviction and execution of the Ceau»ôescus \\"after a mockery of a trial\\". The investigation that led to the indictments had previously been closed in 2009, but was re-opened in 2016 as the result of a trial at the European Court of Human Rights. Abolition of death penalty The Ceau»ôescus were the last people to be executed in Romania before the abolition of capital punishment on 7 January 1990.

There are eight separate defined-benefit pension plans administered by URS, as well as various retirement savings plans. As of December 31, 2014, the URS was managing over $31 billion in its pension trust funds, for nearly 200,000 members.\\"URS 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,\\" p. 53. Besides the pension trust funds, the URS manages a 401(k), 457(b), a traditional IRA and Roth IRA with around $4.5 billion in assets combined at the end of 2014.  Membership  Members of the eight URS pension systems are the employees of over 700 different employers. The two largest systems are the Public Employees Noncontributory Retirement Systems, Tier I and Tier II, with 463 participating employers including all of Utah's school districts, the State of Utah, and its counties and various political subdivisions. The old Contributory system has 159 employers, the Public Safety system has 131, and the Firefighters' system has 59 employers. (Tier 2 Public Safety and Firefighters has 149.) There is a separate retirement system for Judges, and one for Governors and Legislators. 161 employers participate in the URS 457 Savings Plans, and 380 in the 401(k) Plans.\\"URS 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,\\" p. 189.  Governance  URS is run by a seven-member board whose members are appointed by the governor. Four of the members represent the investment community, one represents the teachers, and one represents state employees. The state treasurer is an ex-officio member of the retirement board. The board appoints the Executive Director. In addition to the Retirement Board, there is an advisory Membership Council made up of representatives from the member employee groups.\\"URS 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,\\" p. 11.  History  Many public employees in Utah had some kind of pension before the creation of the URS in 1963. As early as 1919, there was a statewide retirement system for firefighters. Many cities had a retirement system for their police in the 1920s. In 1927, prison guards got a retirement system. All of these would eventually be absorbed into URS-administered systems.\\"About Utah Retirement Systems - History\\" on URS website In 1934, the Utah Education Association drew up a plan for a retirement system for teachers. This became the basis for the Teachers' Retirement System, which went into effect in 1937, covering both teachers and administrators. The \\"State Officers' and Employees' Retirement System of Utah,\\" later named the Public Employees' Retirement System, was created in 1947. Also, optional state coverage was established for judges and local government employees. In 1963, joint administration was established for public employees and teachers systems. The School Employees System, Public Employees System, Judges System, Public Safety System (including Highway Patrol), Prison Guards System, former Employee Retirement System, and Firefighters System were placed under a single board. The Public employees and Teachers Employees systems were consolidated into the State Retirement System. This was the creation of the URS. Later, in the 1970s, Utah Firefighters System and Judges System were added. Also, the Utah Legislature established a subcommittee on Retirement. In the 1980s, custody of the Retirement funds was transferred to the Retirement Board from the State Treasurer, and the Retirement System became an independent agency. The Retirement Board was restructured, altering the board membership and establishing a membership council. A system for judges was added in the 1990s. In 2010, the Utah legislature created a \\"Tier II\\" retirement plan for new employees, with a smaller benefit than the old plan.Under Tier I, employees are eligible to receive 2% of their salary per year of employment; e.g. retirement after 30 years earns a pension that's 60% of their salary. Under Tier II, employees earn 1.5% of their salary per year of employment. The motivation was to avoid the pension problems that have affected or threatened to affect many other jurisdictions. People hired after July 1, 2011, choose either a traditional pension plan or a 401(k)-type plan, with the state contributing 10 percent of an employee's salary (12 percent for uniformed workers) to whichever plan a worker chooses. Employer contributions to the pension plan for new employees are capped at 10% of the employees salary. The 'Tier II' plans require 5 more years of employment for eligibility. The legislature also limited post-retirement re-employment.

It is a relatively uncommon species and is found in shallow seas in the Caribbean region. Description Plexaurella nutans can grow to a height of over a metre (yard). It has thick cylindrical branches that occasionally fork and which are often slightly clubbed at the tips. These have a diameter of . The polyps are rather large and protrude from round, oval or slit-shaped grooves in the cup-shaped calyces in the coral skeleton. Each of these calyces is on a slight mound giving the coral a dimpled surface. When the polyps are extended, as they usually are, they give the coral a fuzzy appearance. The colour of this coral is usually pale brown, grey or sometimes lavender. Distribution and habitat Plexaurella nutans is an uncommon species and occurs at depths down to in the Caribbean Sea, the Bahamas and Florida. It is usually found on isolated patch reefs or on forereef slopes. Biology The polyps of Plexaurella nutans extend their tentacles to feed on zooplankton and other small invertebrates floating past. The food gathered is shared with neighbouring polyps via the gastrovascular cavity inside the coral's skeleton. After particles of liver marked with a radioactive tracer were fed experimentally to a single polyp, radioactivity was detected in tissues up to away. Plexaurella nutans is a zooxanthellate species of coral with large numbers of symbiotic dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium living in its tissues. These are photosynthetic algae that provide nourishment to their host while benefiting from the coral's waste products. It was found experimentally that different species of Symbiodinium were found at different depths in Plexaurella nutans and other corals. If the corals' tissues were cultured in the laboratory, other species again became apparent, the growth of which was favoured by the laboratory environment. These must have been undetected in the tissues previously.

It appears to be quite androgenic, with about one-third and one-fifth of the androgenic and anabolic activity, respectively, of nandrolone in animal bioassays. However, it has also been reported to have little anabolic activity. Chemistry Norvinisterone, also known as 17Œ±-vinyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17Œ±-vinylestr-4-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone and 19-nortestosterone. Analogues of norvinisterone include the progestin norgesterone and the AAS vinyltestosterone. History Norvinisterone was synthesized in 1953 and was studied in humans by 1960. Society and culture Generic names Norvinisterone is the generic name of the drug and its . It is also known as vinylnortestosterone and is known by its developmental code name SC-4641. Brand names Norvinisterone was marketed under the brand names Neoprogestin and Nor-Progestelea by Syntex. Availability Norgesterone is no longer marketed and hence is no longer available in any country.http://www.micromedexsolutions.com/micromedex2/ References Category:1-Ethenylcyclopentanols Category:Androgens and anabolic steroids Category:Estranes Category:Hepatotoxins Category:Hormonal contraception Category:Progestogens Category:Vinyl compounds ","title":"Norvinisterone"},{"id":"37986333","text":"Joseph Jules Zerey (born 9 June 1941 in Alexandria, Egypt) is a retired archbishop of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church and former Apostolic Vicar of Jerusalem.

The story line begins shortly before the Bombing of Rotterdam and concerns the impossible love between a young boxer (Smit) and an engaged girl (Van Erkel) as the Second World War reaches the Netherlands. The film was critically panned following its release.  Plot  The film is set in May 1940 in and around the city of Rotterdam, where a young baker's assistant (and aspiring amateur boxer) Vincent de Graaf meets the wealthy Eva von Heerle, the daughter of German refugees who had fled Nazi Germany. Eva is engaged to Dirk Lagerwaard, a wealthy older industrial whom she does not love, whereas Vincent wants to emigrate to the United States to find a cure for his sick brother. The two fall in love. As German troops invade the Netherlands, Vincent offers Dirk to bring Eva and her parents to Rotterdam resulting in a dangerous journey through the frontlines as Dutch and German troops clash in bitter combat. As the two reach Rotterdam, an ultimatum is delivered to the Dutch troops defending the city in which they are summoned to surrender immediately or face destruction, the Dutch soldiers refused, but Rottrdam was declared an open city. Unfortunately the German bombers were supposed to have been recalled resulting in the near destruction of the open city. Very traumatic - changing the future for everyone involved.  Reception  The film received negative reviews. Several critics attacked the film's plot, which was said to be a bad imitation of the story line of Titanic (1997). Both concerned an impossible love between a lower class boy and an upper class girl already engaged to wealthy but unloving older man culminating in a dramatic disaster.http://www.spitsnieuws.nl/archives/entertainment/2012/12/recensie- het-bombardement Sp!ts review, 19 December 2012 Others considered many of the characters to be stereotypes and criticized the film for its corny dialogues, bad acting and predictability, the De Telegraaf finding the romance plot to be as predictable as the bombing itself. The film also provoked public outcry from several survivors of the Rotterdam bombing, who were offended that the bombing was used as a mere plot element for a simplistic romance film. The Algemeen Dagblad called the film poorly made and offensive to the victims of the bombing with a Belgian critic going on to say that watching the film was the worst experience in his life.

The source of his artistic inspiration in his later years was the work of Wassily Kandinsky and Arshile Gorky.–î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º –æ –°–µ–π—Ä–∞–Ω–µ –•–∞—Ç–ª–∞–º–∞–¥–∂—è–Ω–µ, 1-–π –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª –¢–í –ê—Ä–º–µ–Ω–∏–∏, 35 –º–Ω, –ï—Ä–µ–≤–∞–Ω, 2007 –≥. In the abstract genre Seiran Khatlamadjian used as a soft, transparent tone and active and bright colors. The artist is also known for his series of \\"Magic Armenia\\", which is an artistic fusion of history and mythology, reality and mystery, paganism and Christianity. Khatlamadjian participated in many ethnographic expeditions to Armenia and painted landscapes in all its regions. In this case, all of his creative life was entirely related to Armenia, where he settled and drew several paintings which were highly respected by the public and professionals.Documentary about Seiran Khatlamadjian by TV \\"Shoghakat\\", 25 mn, Yerevan, 2005. In 1967, he became a member of the Artists' Union of Armenia. Seiran Khatlamadjian left a large number of paintings and drawings, some of which are exhibited in the Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), National Gallery of Armenia, Contemporary Art Museum (Yerevan), Museum of Oriental Cultures (Moscow), Gnessins Music Institute (Moscow), Rostov Regional Museum of Local History, Nonconformist Art Museum (New Jersey, USA), and in a number of state buildings in Armenia such as the Constitutional Court, Residence of President, and National Assembly. His work is also exposit in many private collections in Armenia and abroad. Seiran Khatlamadjian show an emotional quality parallel with the art of Arshile Gprky. Khatlamajian has the vibrant line, but he is the more lyrical of in his finely executed drawings and his abstract canvases (1991-1994). Freed of the constraints of figurative art, this artist create a visual structure, which, at its best, can be considered a plastic formula for the Armenian spirit: a polyphonic harmony of colors penetrated by sharp and thorn- like lines. This coexistence in his works of peaceful harmony and dramatic disturbance reflecting the troubled course of Armenian history.Vartoug Basmadjian, Light in darkness: The spirit of Armenian nonconformist art, Nonconformist Art The Soviet Experience 1956-1986, (pp 227-237 and 249-250), ed. Thames & Hudson Seiran Khatlamadjian took active part in the public life in Armenia and was not limited to his role as artist. With his direct participation, Khatlamadjian developed and adopted state symbols for the Republic of Armenia. He actively searched archives and studied the state anthem of the First Republic of Armenia (1918-1920.) Khatlamadjian contributed to the restoration of the Armenian coat of arms which was created by the architect Alexander Tamanyan and academician of the Russian Academy of Arts Hakob Kojoyan. He has been actively campaigning for its approval as a national state anthem of independent Armenia which was approved on April 19, 1992 by the Supreme Council of Armenia.

It runs crowd- funding campaigns for independent journalistic organizations. The organization's board of directors has included prominent journalists and whistleblowers such as Daniel Ellsberg, Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald, and Xeni Jardin, as well as activists, celebrities, and filmmakers. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden joined FPF's board of directors in 2014 and began serving as its president in early 2016. Jardin left the board in 2016.  Crowdfunding  The organization's founding was inspired by the WikiLeaks financial blockade. When FPF launched in late 2012, it was the first time people could donate to WikiLeaks via Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal since the payment processors cut off WikiLeaks in late 2010. In December 2017, after five years of processing donations on behalf of WikiLeaks, FPF's board unanimously found that the blockade was no longer in effect, and severed ties with WikiLeaks as of January 8, 2018. FPF has also crowd-funded support for a variety of other transparency journalism organizations, as well as encryption tools used by journalists, including: WikiLeaks, MuckRock, the National Security Archive, The UpTake, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the Center for Public Integrity, Truthout, the LEAP Encryption Access Project, Open Whisper Systems, Tails, and the Tor Project. In May 2013, FPF raised over $100,000 online donations to hire a professional court stenographer to take transcripts during the trial of whistleblower Chelsea Manning after the government refused to make its transcripts available to the public. They posted the transcripts online at the end of each day of the trial for members of the media to use in their reports. Secrecy expert Steven Aftergood later called the crowd-funding effort \\"unprecedented,\\" saying \\"it eloquently demonstrated public expectations of openness...the court and the prosecutors may have been shamed into reconsidering their habitual secrecy.\\" In October 2014, FPF raised over $28,000 for New Zealand independent journalist Nicky Hager to fund his legal challenge against the government of New Zealand after his house was raided by police following a book he wrote. A court later ruled the raid of Hager's house was illegal. In 2015, FPF raised more than $125,000 online for Chelsea Manning's legal defense stemming from her conviction under the Espionage Act for leaking information to WikiLeaks. Notwithstanding the January 2017 commutation of her sentence and May 2017 release from prison, Manning's military appeal is ongoing. As of June 2018, FPF accepts donations with crypto-currencies.https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/18/17475204/freedom- press-foundation-cryptocurrency-donation-bitcoin-ether  Technical projects  In October 2013, FPF took over the development of SecureDrop, an open source whistleblower submission system developed in part by the late programmer and transparency activist Aaron Swartz., who developed it with Kevin Poulsen and James Dolan. Dolan moved it to FPF upon the death of Swartz. The SecureDrop system facilitates anonymous communication between two parties using the Tor Network, and allows whistleblowers to contact journalists without ever exchanging one another's identities or contact information. The system is now in use at over two dozen major news organizations, including The Washington Post, The Guardian, The New Yorker, ProPublica, Gawker, HuffPost, and The Intercept. According to a study done by Columbia Journalism School, it has since successfully led to the publication of many stories at the news organizations that use it. FPF also teaches journalists how to use other encryption and digital security tools to better protect their sources. In collaboration with The Guardian Project, FPF released a free and open-source mobile app named Haven in 2017. Haven turns an Android device into a security sensor and, optionally, alerts the device owner to activity occurring in its vicinity.https://www.wired.com/story/snowden-haven-app-turns-phone-into-home- security-system/  Legal activism  Freedom of the Press Foundation has been involved in several Freedom of Information Act cases surrounding journalists' rights and government transparency. In January 2016, FPF's lawsuit against the Justice Department revealed that the US government has secret rules for targeting journalists with National Security Letters (NSLs) and FISA court orders. In March 2016, another FPF lawsuit showed that the Obama administration secretly lobbied against bipartisan Freedom of Information Act reform in Congress, despite the bill being based word-for-word on the Obama administration's supposed transparency guidelines.  Awards  FPF co- founders Daniel Ellsberg, John Perry Barlow, Trevor Timm, and Rainey Reitman won the 2013 Hugh Hefner First Amendment award for their role in founding FPF. The organization was the recipient of the Society of Professional Journalists' James Madison award in 2016.

Ratchadamnoen Nai is the first segment on the left, along Sanam Luang, Ratchadamnoen Klang is the second segment (from west to east), and Ratchadamnoen Nok is the last on the right, to Dusit Palace Ratchadamnoen Avenue (, , , also spelled Rajdamnern) is a historic road in the Phra Nakhon and Dusit Districts of Bangkok, Thailand. Ratchadamnoen Avenue may be the most politically charged thoroughfare in the capital, as its history captures the ebb and flow of Thai ideological struggles over Thai governance in the 20th and 21st centuries. Description Ratchadamnoen Nai Road begins at the northeast corner of the Grand Palace and leads northward to the Phan Phiphop Lila Bridge, which crosses the old city moat. The road then continues east as Ratchadamnoen Klang until it crosses Khlong Rop Krung (the outer moat) at Phan Fa Lilat Bridge, where it turns northward toward the Royal Plaza. Ratchadamnoen Nok, in particular, was designed to impart Western-style grandeur, with three carriageways with wide pavements lined by multiple rows of trees. Today, the avenue serves as a major thoroughfare bringing traffic into the old city centre and across Phra Pin-klao Bridge to the Thonburi side of the city. It is bordered by government offices, including the Government House. The Democracy Monument sits in the centre of Ratchadamnoen Klang Road. The avenue has been the site of many demonstrations, including the 1973 student uprising as well as more recent political rallies. History Ratchadamnoen Avenue was commissioned by King Chulalongkorn following his first visit to Europe in 1897. Construction took place from 1899 to 1903. The road consists of three segments, named Ratchadamnoen Nai, Ratchadamnoen Klang, and Ratchadamnoen Nok (Inner, Middle, and Outer Ratchadamnoen, respectively). It links the Grand Palace to Dusit Palace in the new royal district, terminating at the Royal Plaza in front of the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. Inspired by the Champs-√âlys√©es and other European boulevards, the King used the road as a route for grand royal parades (Ratchadamnoen literally means 'royal procession'), which served to project images of a modern monarchy. In January 2020, it was announced that ten buildings flanking a 1.2 kilometre stretch of the avenue, owned by the Crown Property Bureau, would be renovated or demolished. The bureau proposes rebuilding the structures in \\"neoclassical- style\\", obliterating the Art Deco theme originally inspired by the spirit of the 1932 revolution that overthrew absolute monarchy.

It was published by Crown Publishing Group in June 2012. The novel became quite popular and soon made the New York Times Best Seller list. The sense of suspense in the novel comes from whether or not Nick Dunne is involved in the disappearance of his wife Amy. In several interviews, Flynn has said that she was inspired to write the novel by the disappearance of Californian Laci Peterson in late 2002. Portraying her principal characters as out-of-work writers, she made use of her own experience being laid off from her job as a writer for Entertainment Weekly. Critics in the United States positively received and reviewed the novel. Reviewers praised the novel's use of unreliable narration, plot twists, and suspense. A film adaptation was released on October 3, 2014, directed by David Fincher, and written by Flynn herself, with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike starring in lead roles. The film was met with both commercial success and widespread critical acclaim.  Plot summary  The first part of the novel centers on Nick Dunne and Amy Elliott's marriage. Its point of view alternates between that of Nick and Amy, whose perspectives on their marriage are very different. For example, Nick describes the couple's relationship in the present day, while Amy's diary entries depict their relationship in the past. Amy's diary portrays Nick as an aggressive, moody, idle, and threatening husband, while Nick describes Amy as someone who is needlessly difficult, anti-social, stubborn, and an irrational perfectionist. When Nick and Amy both lose their jobs in New York City, they relocate to Nick's hometown in North Carthage, Missouri, to help take care of Nick's sick mother. This causes their marriage to take a turn: Amy loved their life in New York, hates living in the Midwest, and soon begins to resent Nick for making her move to his hometown. On their wedding anniversary, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick eventually becomes a suspect in her disappearance. Among other reasons, his lack of emotion about Amy's disappearance and the discovery that Amy was pregnant when she went missing lead both the police and the public to believe that Nick may have murdered his wife. In the second half of the book, the reader learns that the main characters are unreliable narrators and that the reader is not being given all of the information. Nick is revealed to have been cheating on his wife, and Amy is revealed to be alive and in hiding and trying to frame Nick for her \\"death\\" as revenge for his perceived wrongs against her. Her pregnancy and her diary entries are revealed to be fake; Amy fabricated them in order to incriminate Nick further. However, her plan is foiled when she is robbed at the motel she is hiding in. Desperate, she seeks help from her ex-boyfriend Desi Collings, who agrees to hide her in his lake house but soon becomes possessive, causing Amy to feel trapped. Meanwhile, Nick has discovered that Amy is framing him for her murder by making purchases using credit cards in his name and hiding them in his sister Margo's woodshed, along with her anniversary gift of Punch and Judy puppets, one of which is missing a handle. However, since the clues she left for him on their anniversary treasure hunt are so vague, and based on their inside jokes that no one else would get, he has no way of proving it. Together, he and his lawyer work to change the public's perception of Nick. He is granted an interview with a popular talk show host, during which Nick pretends to be apologetic for his infidelity and appeals to Amy to come back. It goes well with the public, but unfortunately, the police have discovered in the woodshed boxes of demeaning and violent porn videos, which Nick swears he did not buy, and Amy's diary. A few weeks later, they bring out the missing handle from the Punch and Judy puppets, soaked in Amy's blood, which has been discovered in the river, and arrest Nick. At Desi's lake house, Amy sees the TV interview and is convinced that Nick really does want her back. She murders Desi after seducing him and returns to her husband, who is out on bond. Upon her return, she fabricates a story that she was kidnapped and imprisoned by Desi. Although Nick knows she is lying, he has no proof and is forced to return to married life with Amy as the media storm dies down. He soon begins writing a memoir detailing Amy's crimes and deceptions. Aware of Nick's intentions to expose her lies, Amy uses Nick's semen, which they saved at a fertility clinic, to make herself pregnant. She then forces him to delete his book by threatening to keep him from their unborn child. In the end, Nick deletes his memoir and chooses to stay with Amy for his child's sake.  Characters  * Amy Elliott Dunne: The title character. She is very beautiful but proves to be a clever sociopath. She is the source of inspiration for her parents' \\"Amazing Amy\\" book series. She made a living in New York as a writer for personality quizzes and met Nick at a writers' party; they marry after two years of dating, and the marriage starts out great until they both get laid off, her parents ask for financial help, and she and Nick move to North Carthage, Missouri, after no longer being able to afford living in New York City. After that, she becomes very resentful toward Nick as he grows increasingly distant and depressed with the stress of his mother's death and father's dementia. Upon realizing that he was cheating on her, Amy spends a year developing a complex plan to frame her husband for her own murder. By utilizing her calculating intelligence and charm, she eventually returns and manages to convince the public that she was kidnapped and raped by an old boyfriend. Nick, Boney, and Go are all convinced of her guilt, but they are unable to prove it. Amy ultimately blackmails Nick into staying with her by inseminating herself with his sperm. He realizes that he now can never be free of her, and if he leaves his child would grow to hate him under Amy's manipulations. * Nick Dunne: Raised in a working-class household with a misogynistic father who later suffered from Alzheimer's, a mother who later developed cancer, and a twin sister with whom he is close. Nick grew up as the golden child of the family and held several jobs throughout his adolescence. He worked as a journalist in New York City until he was laid off during the 2009 recession. He returned to his hometown with his wife Amy, where he was weighed down by his mother's cancer and father's dementia. Amy give him money to open \\"The Bar\\" with his twin sister Go. He begins to fall out of love with Amy and has an affair with one of his students, Andie. When Amy finds out about his affair, she retaliates by concocting a plan to frame Nick for her kidnapping. Nick eventually realizes her plan and manipulated her into coming home by saying what he knew she wanted to hear during television interviews. When Amy returns, Nick tried to convince her to divorce him, but she refuses. He ultimately stays with her because she inseminates herself with his sperm and he knows he will never be free of her. He doesn't want his child to grow up hating him, or to give Amy the opportunity to falsely accuse him of abuse. * Jim Gilpin: A detective who participated in Nick's investigation. He is described by Nick as having \\"fleshy bags under his eyes\\" and \\"scraggly white whiskers in his mustache.\\" * Rhonda Boney: A detective who participated in Nick's investigation. She has a younger brother whom she \\"dotes on,\\" and is the mother of a teenaged daughter, Mia. She is described by Nick as \\"ugly,\\" although he says he has an \\"affinity\\" for \\"ugly women.\\" She does not want to believe Nick is really guilty despite the seeming evidence piling on the case and gives him the benefit of the doubt until things really take a turn for the worse. When Amy returns, Nick tells Boney about Amy's confession but nobody is able to find enough evidence against her. * Tanner Bolt: Nick's lawyer, a defense attorney who specializes in defending husbands accused of murdering their spouses. * Andie Hardy: A woman in her early 20s with whom Nick cheats on Amy. Andie met Nick as a student in his magazine-writing class, and their affair began 15 months before Amy's disappearance. She appears genuinely in love with Nick and becomes very resentful when he abandons her due to Amy's disappearance. Andie goes on a talk show and tells the story of their affair at the same time that Nick confesses to his infidelity during a separate interview. * Margo (\\"Go\\") Dunne: Nick's twin sister, with whom he owns a bar and has a close relationship. She remains loyal to Nick throughout the murder investigation, despite her suspicions. * Desi Collings: Amy's boyfriend in high school, who is described as wealthy and obsessed with Amy. In their youth, she manipulated her parents into thinking that he was stalking her and overdosed in her bedroom. While she is on the run, Amy is robbed of all her money. She reaches out to Desi for financial help and manipulates him into falling in love with her by using his pompous savior nature against him. However, he doesn't give her money-rather, he brings her to a summer home where he essentially keeps her prisoner by not giving her any money, keys, or the gate security code. Amy quickly grows resentful of his controlling disguised as caring behavior. Her last night at Desi's house, she seduces him, puts sleeping pills in his cocktail and kills him. She later revealed that she had been abusing herself with a wine bottle and tying twine around her wrists to leave marks in order to make it look like Desi kidnapped and raped her. Desi's mother remained convinced of his innocence, but nobody is able to find evidence of Amy's guilt.  Composition and publication  Gillian Flynn is a former writer for Entertainment Weekly who wrote two popular novels prior to Gone Girl ‚Äî Sharp Objects and Dark Places. Gone Girl is her best selling book to date. Her other two books were about people incapable of making commitments, but in this novel, she tried to depict the ultimate commitment, marriage: \\"I liked the idea of marriage told as a he-said, she-said story, and told by two narrators who were perhaps not to be trusted.\\" Flynn has also described marriage as \\"the ultimate mystery.\\" Flynn admits to putting some of herself in the character of Nick Dunne. Like Dunne, she was a popular culture writer. Also, like Dunne, she was laid off after many years at the same job. Flynn said, \\"I certainly wove that experience, that sense of having something that you were going to do for the rest of your life and seeing that possibility taken away... I definitely wove that sense of unrest and nervousness into Nick's character.\\" Asked how she can write so believably about a man's inner life, Flynn says, \\"I'm kind of part guy myself.\\" When she needs to understand something about how men think, she asks her husband or a male friend. Flynn's autobiographical essay \\"I Was Not a Nice Little Girl...\\" invites readers to believe she took inspiration for Amy Dunne from her own interior monologue. In that essay, Flynn confesses to sadistic childhood impulses like \\"stunning ants and feeding them to spiders.\\" A favourite indoor game called \\"Mean Aunt Rosie\\" allowed Flynn to cast herself as a \\"witchy caregiver\\" who exercised malevolent influence over her cousins. The same essay argues that women fail to acknowledge their own violent impulses and incorporate them into their personal narratives, though men tend to cherish stories of their childhood meanness. Flynn identified Zo√´ Heller's Notes on a Scandal and Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? as influences on her writing and, in particular, on the plot and themes of Gone Girl. Flynn said she admired the \\"ominous\\" ending of Notes on a Scandal and the pathology of a bad marriage from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. For the conclusion of Gone Girl, Flynn drew from Rosemary's Baby: \\"I love that it just ends with, you know, 'Hey, the devil's in the world, and guess what? Mom kind of likes him!'\\", she said. Flynn also says she is influenced by the mystery writers Laura Lippman, Karin Slaughter, George Pelecanos, Dennis Lehane, and Harlan Coben. However, she tries not to read any one genre exclusively, and she also admires Joyce Carol Oates, Margaret Atwood, T.C. Boyle, and Arthur Phillips, who are better known as realistic contemporary writers. Gone Girl is also the title of a Lew Archer story, in the 1955 collection The Name is Archer, by Ross Macdonald, who Flynn has also cited as a favorite author.Goodreads listing.  Genre  Gone Girl is an example of mystery, suspense, and crime genres. A Reader's Digest review, for instance, notes that the book is \\"more than just a crime novel\\". The review goes on to describe Gone Girl as a \\"masterful psychological thriller\\" which offers \\"an astute and thought-provoking look into two complex personalities\\". A Chicago Tribune review notes that Gone Girl uses many of the devices common to thrillers‚Äîa cast of viable suspects, unfolding secrets, and red herrings. However, the novel does more with these devices than the thriller genre requires: \\"While serving their usual functions, they also do much more, launching us into an unnerving dissection of the fallout of failed dreams.\\" In her New York Times review, Janet Maslin also writes that the elements of Gone Girl that \\"sound like standard-issue crime story machinations\\" are not, because both narrators are also consummate liars and cannot be trusted to convey the truth about their own stories. Salon.com writes that Gone Girl has literary features that enhance the crime genre features, adding that Flynn is \\"kicking the genre into high gear.\\" Flynn herself says that, in writing Gone Girl, she employed the mystery genre as a \\"thru-lane\\" to explore what she was really interested in: relationships.  Themes  Gone Girl's themes include dishonesty, the devious media, the unhappiness that comes with a troubled economy, and the superficial nature of appearance. The characters lie to each other and the reader about affairs and disappearances. Amy fabricates a fake diary to implicate her husband for her disappearance and murder. Flynn says that, in writing the book, she wanted to examine how people within a marriage lie to each other: \\"marriage is sort of like a long con, because you put on display your very best self during courtship, yet at the same time the person you marry is supposed to love you warts and all. But your spouse never sees those warts really until you get deeper into the marriage and let yourself unwind a bit.\\" An underlying theme is the brief undertone of feminism, most notably represented in Amy's 'Cool Girl' speech. For some, it is in this monologue that the otherwise despised Amazing Amy emerges as an unlikely heroine of sorts; flying the flag for women who refuse to succumb to the pressure to morph into the male's ideal. Flynn is a self-identified feminist and has stated that Amy's \\"just pragmatically evil\\" character and non-conformity to the traditional perception of women as innately good characters are the embodiment of feminism, which she defined as \\"the ability to have women who are bad characters.\\" Several reviews have also noted how well Gone Girl shows the tricky nature of media representation. Nick seems guilty due to media coverage before a trial occurs. Salon.com notes that \\"Flynn, a former staff writer for Entertainment Weekly, is especially good on the infiltration of the media into every aspect of the missing-person investigation, from Nick's cop-show-based awareness that the husband is always the primary suspect to a raving tabloid-TV Fury, who is out to avenge all wronged women and obviously patterned on Nancy Grace.\\" Entertainment writer Jeff Giles notes that the novel also plays on reader expectations that the husband will be the murderer, expectations that have also been shaped by the media, writing, \\"The first half of Gone Girl is a nimble, caustic riff on our Nancy Grace culture and the way in which 'The butler did it' has morphed into 'The husband did it.'\\" A New York Daily News review also notes the novel's interest in how quickly a husband can be convicted in the media: \\"In a media society informed by Nancy Grace, when a wife goes missing, the husband murdered her. There's no need for a body to arrive at a verdict.\\" A San Francisco Chronicle review also notes the book's recurring commentary on media influence: \\"Flynn pokes smart fun at cable news, our collective obsession with social media and reality TV.\\" Flynn has also said that she wanted this novel to capture the sense of bankruptcy that both individuals and communities feel when the economy spirals. Not only have both her main characters lost their jobs, they have also moved to a town that is blighted by unsold houses and failed businesses. \\"I wanted the whole thing to feel bankrupt ... I wanted it to really feel like a marriage that had been hollowed out in a city that had been hollowed out and a country that was increasingly hollowed out,\\" said Flynn. Amy's \\"Cool Girl\\" speech and the vital task of Nick's performing for his media spectators, highlight the importance of establishing and maintaining appearances, however false. Flynn said this: \\"The whole point is that these are two people pretending to be other people, better people, versions of the dream guy and dream girl, but each one couldn't keep it up, so they destroy each other\\".Maureen Dowd (12 October 2014), \\"Lady psychopaths welcome\\", The New York Times, p. SR11. Amy creates her plan to frame her husband when Nick fails to maintain the false image Amy married, which she feels she is owed for keeping her side of the bargain by pretending to be his \\"cool girl\\" fantasy. She only returns to him after he gives a convincing public performance in the role of perfect husband. However, it is not his sincerity she is attracted to, she knows he is putting on an act, but the appearance of it. Amy views Nick as her ideal husband in the end because she knows he must appear to be her ideal husband, permanently, due to her blackmail and the risk of public condemnation. In exchange, she will appear as an ideal wife and mother, a trade Nick accepts. Both prefer the appearance the other projects over the reality of the person they married.  Reception  Gone Girl was #1 on the New York Times Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list for eight weeks. It was also twenty-six weeks on National Public Radio's hardcover fiction bestseller list. Culture writer Dave Itzkoff wrote that the novel was, excepting books in the Fifty Shades trilogy, the biggest literary phenomenon of 2012. By the end of its first year in publication, Gone Girl had sold over two million copies in print and digital editions, according to the book's publisher. Gone Girl has been widely praised in numerous publications including the New Yorker, The New York Times, Time, Publishers Weekly, Entertainment Weekly, Chatelaine, People, and USA Today. Reviewers express admiration for the novel's suspense, a plot twist involving an unreliable narrator, its psychological dimension, and its examination of a marriage that has become corrosive. Entertainment Weekly describes it as \\"an ingenious and viperish thriller.\\" The New Yorker describes it as a \\"mostly well-crafted novel,\\" praising its depiction of an \\"unraveling\\" marriage and a \\"recession-hit Midwest,\\" while finding its conclusion somewhat \\"outlandish.\\"(20 August 2012) Retrieved with ProQuest. The New York Times likens Gillian Flynn to acclaimed suspense novelist Patricia Highsmith. Gone Girl, the Times goes on to say, is Flynn's \\"dazzling breakthrough,\\" adding that the novel is \\"wily, mercurial, subtly layered and populated by characters so well imagined that they're hard to part with.\\" A USA Today review focuses on bookseller enthusiasm for the book, quoting a Jackson, Mississippi store manager saying, \\"It will make your head spin off.\\" People Magazine's review found the novel \\"a delectable summer read\\" that burrows \\"deep into the murkiest corners of the human psyche.\\" Retrieved from MasterFILE Premier using EBSCO. A Chatelaine review commends the novel's suspense, its intricately detailed plot and the way it keeps the reader \\"unnervingly off balance.\\"Retrieved through EBSCO. Many reviewers have noted the difficulty of writing about Gone Girl, because so little in the first half of the novel is what it seems to be. In his Time review, Lev Grossman describes the novel as a \\"house of mirrors.\\" He also writes \\"Its content may be postmodern, but it takes the form of a thoroughbred thriller about the nature of identity and the terrible secrets that can survive and thrive in even the most intimate relationships.\\" Volume 179, issue 23. Retrieved from Academic Search Premier In an article in Salon.com, Laura Miller laments that Gone Girl was conspicuously absent from the winning ranks of prestigious literary awards, like the National Book Awards, and the Pulitzer Prize. The same article argues that Gone Girl was snubbed because it belongs to the mystery genre. Judges awarding top literary prizes \\"have all refrained from honoring any title published within the major genres.\\" Gone Girl was chosen for the inaugural Salon What To Read Awards (2012). The novel has also been short-listed for the Women's Prize for Fiction. Natasha Walter, one of the Women's Prize judges in 2013, told the Independent that there was considerable debate amongst the judges about the inclusion of Gone Girl in the finalists' circle. Walter indicated that crime fiction is often \\"overlooked\\" by those in a position to make literary commendations.  Adaptations   Audiobook  Gone Girl was recorded as a Random House audiobook, featuring the voices of Julia Whelan as Amy Dunne and Kirby Heyborne as Nick Dunne.

The novel's author Gillian Flynn was engaged to write the screenplay. Witherspoon produced the film version along with Leslie Dixon, Bruna Papandrea, and Ce√°n Chaffin. Witherspoon was drawn to the script because of its strong female character and its use of multiple perspectives and non-linear structure. In May 2013, it was announced that David Fincher was brought on as director, with Ben Affleck cast as Nick and Rosamund Pike in the role of Amy. New Regency and Fox agreed to co-finance the film.

He won the Norwegian Landskappleiken (National Fiddle Contest) four times, in 1947, 1957, 1970 and 1971. Biography Bolstad was born in √òystre Slidre, Oppland county, Norway in 1915, and grew up in the village, where he learnt traditional Norwegian music from Ola Okshovd and Engebret Beitohaugen. He learnt many traditional tunes during his childhood and got his first fiddle at the age of ten. He moved to Oslo in 1947 where he worked with Kjetil L√∏ndal, and the two were regarded as the best concert fiddlers at the time. Bolstad was known for his clean style and good stroke, maintaining a good dance rhythm, and was conscious of the quality of the dancing and the dialogue between dancer and musician. He lived in Oslo until 1960 and worked there as a painter. He moved back to Valdres in the early sixties and made a major contribution to the revival of local folk music tradition there. In 1966 he was engaged as a folk music instructor and a number of fiddling groups were established in the area. Among his pupils were his great-nephew and renowned fiddler Tore Bolstad, as well as Harald R√∏ine, Olav J√∏rgen Hegge and Trygve Bolstad, who names Torleiv Bolstad as one of his most important teachers. In 1971, Bolstad performed in Decorah, Iowa, United States at the Norwegian-American Folk Music Festival, which was part of the Decorah Nordic Fest (July 23‚Äì25), with a group of dancers which included his wife. After Torleiv Bolstad's death in 1979, the folk music work that Torleiv had established in Valdres in the 1960s and 1970s was carried on by Trygve Bolstad, who moved back to Valdres to take over the role. The Torleiv Bolstad Memorial Fund was established to provide grants to young folk musicians. These are awarded at the annual J√∏rn Hilme-stemnet folk festival.

May, 484 U.S. 72 (1987), was a school prayer case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the former presiding officers of the New Jersey legislature did not have Article III standing to appeal a case, that standing had passed on to their legislative successors.. Background In 1982, the New Jersey Legislature passed a statute over the governor's veto providing for a moment of silence in public schools, which failed to specifically mention prayer. May filed a lawsuit in the federal United States District Court for the District of New Jersey challenging the constitutionality of the statute; the executive-branch officials normally tasked with defending such suits (the Governor and the Attorney General) admitted the unconstitutionality of the statute and refused to defend it in court. Consequently, Alan Karcher, Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly, and Carmen Orechio, President of the New Jersey Senate, moved to intervene (under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) as defendants on behalf of the Legislature; the court granted the motion. In 1983, the District Court found that the purpose of the statute was religious, and deemed the law unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds. Karcher and Orechio appealed, although by the time of filing their terms as Speaker and President had expired; their successors, Chuck Hardwick and John F. Russo, joined the executive officers in refusing to defend the constitutionality of the statute. Karcher and Orechio's lawyer, Rex E. Lee, nevertheless contended that their standing to continue to defend suit on the state's behalf remained, and also argued the purpose of the law was secular. Opinion of the Court The court found that the former legislative leaders lacked standing, but that that authority had passed by design to the current leaders of the New Jersey legislature. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's majority decision was joined by six other justices, with Justice Byron White writing a concurring opinion. There was no ninth vote, as Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. had resigned earlier in the year, and no replacement had yet been confirmed. As a result of this opinion, the district court ruling that the law was unconstitutional was left intact.

History Located at the corner of K√∂nigstra√üe and Landhofmeister-Stra√üe in Neue Sorge, the Rococo building served the Huguenot community of the city with French sermons. It was built from 1733 to 1736 according to plans by Joachim Ludwig Schulthei√ü von Unfriedt. King Frederick William I of Prussia, a Calvinist, provided 12,000 Thaler out of the total cost of 18,687. The new church was dedicated on 29 July 1736 in the presence of the king. During negotiations for the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, Pastor La Canal of the church and K√∂nigsberg commerce councillor Prin convinced Napoleon to reduce Prussia's war indemnity from 20 million to 12 million francs. Beginning in 1817 German sermons were given every fourth week, but by 1831 all weekly sermons were again in French. The parish was fluent in German, but adhered to its Huguenot past out of tradition. Pastor Louise Guillaume Daniel Detroit denounced the Athanasian Creed in 1847, leading to his removal in 1852. The French Reformed Church was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg and 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg. Its ruins in Kaliningrad were demolished from 1967 to 1968. Design Built as an elongated decagon, the church had a lighter and graceful look. The square central space was surrounded by elliptical side aisles supported by columns. The wooden pulpit dated from 1737, while the tassel-decorated organ was made in 1739. The central archive in Berlin of the Evangelical Church in Germany contains artifacts from the church, including a gilded silver goblet (1690 by Paul M√ºller), a copy of the goblet (1749 by Cornelius Muerkerk), and a gilded ciborium of silver (1699 by Paul M√ºller).

The original German name is Tischlein deck dich, Goldesel und Kn√ºppel aus dem Sack. Plot A tailor had three sons who were all fed by the milk of their goat. The oldest son was given the task to let the animal graze at the finest grass fields. At the end of the day the son asked the goat whether it had eaten enough and the animal confirmed this. However, when they returned home the goat claimed the opposite, causing the tailor to get upset and drive his son out of the house. This pattern repeats itself with the second oldest and youngest son too, who are also falsely blamed by the goat for not feeding it enough and as a result are kicked out of the house as well. Only when the father goes out to feed the goat himself and discovers that the creature still claims it hasn't eaten enough does he realize he misjudged his sons. He takes his razor, shaves the goat bare and uses his whip to drive it out of his house. The tailor is left alone in his house longing for his sons' return. The story then follows each son individually. The first one went to a maker of furniture and learned the craft. After his service his master gave him a magic table as a sign of gratitude. Whenever he says \\"Table, Deck Yourself\\" the table decks itself with the finest food and wine. The son decides to travel home and show his father what he learned and earned. On his way he visits a local inn, where he demonstrates the powers of the magic table. At night the inn keeper steals the table and switches it for a normal table, without the son being aware. When the son arrives home and tries to show the powers of the table to his father nothing happens, which upsets his father once again. Arthur Rackham, 1917 The second son goes to work for a miller. His master gives him a magical donkey who is able to produce gold out of its mouth and behind at the command of \\"Bricklebrit!\\" Just like the oldest son, the second son decides to travel home and happens to visit the same inn his brother did. He too demonstrates the powers of the donkey to the innkeeper who once again steals the animal at night and replaces it with a normal donkey, without the son being aware of what happened. When the son arrives home and tries to show the powers of the donkey instead of gold pieces landing on the cloth, it is droppings like an ordinary donkey, which upsets his father once again. The third son went to work for a woodturner and is given a magic cudgel in a bag. Whenever someone is injust the owner of the cudgel just needs to say: \\"Cudgel, out the sack!\\" and the object will start clobbering the wrongdoer. Only when the owner says: \\"Cudgel in the sack!\\" will the thing return in the bag. Just like his brothers, the son visits the same inn, because he learned from their letters on what had happened. Instead of demonstrating the powers of his possession he deliberately remains vague about it, making the inn keeper curious enough to go out at night and try to look what's in the bag. Anticipating this, the son orders the cudgel to beat the inn keeper up until he returns everything he has stolen. When the son returns home with the table, donkey and cudgel he tells his father what had happened and demonstrates the powers of the objects. His father finally makes peace with his sons and they all live a rich life ever after. As an epilogue, the story also informs the reader what happened to the goat. The shaven animal went to hide inside a fox hole. When the fox returned home it was scared away by the goat's eyes. The fox asks a bear for help, but he is also too frightened to go in. Finally they take a bee along with them, who stings the goat, causing the animal to run away in pain. The storyteller concludes that nobody knows where she is now.

He is best known for his pen-and-ink illustrations of works by authors such as Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and J. M. Barrie. Thomson inaugurated the Cranford School of illustration with the publication of the 1891 Macmillan reissue of Mrs. Gaskell's Cranford. Biography Hugh Thomson was born to tea merchant John Thomson (1822‚Äì1894) and shopkeeper Catherine (n√©e Andrews) (d. 1871). He was the eldest of their three surviving children. Although he had no formal artistic training, as a young boy he would often fill his schoolbooks with drawings of horses, dogs, and ships. He attended Coleraine Model School, but left at the age of fourteen to work as a clerk at E. Gribbon & Sons, Linen Manufacturers.Illustrated by Hugh Thomson, 1860‚Äì1920. Comp. Olivia Fitzpatrick and Debby Shorley. Belfast: University of Ulster at Belfast, 1989. Several years later his artistic talents were discovered, and in 1877 he was hired by printing and publishing company Marcus Ward & Co. On 29 December 1884 Thomson married Jessie Naismith Miller in Belfast. Soon afterwards they moved back to London for Thomson's career. They had one son together, John, born in 1886. In 1911, he and his family moved to Sidcup, hoping to improve their \\"ever delicate health.\\" Thomson's correspondence reflects the fact that he missed being close to the National Gallery and the museums where he usually compiled research for his illustrations. During World War I, demand for Thomson's work decreased to a few propaganda pamphlets and some commissions from friends. By 1917, Thomson had fallen on financial hardship and he had to take a job with the Board of Trade, where he worked until 1919. Thomson died of heart disease at his home in Wandsworth Common on 7 May 1920. Career At the age of 17, Thomson joined the art department at Marcus Ward & Co. There his mentor was John Vinycomb, head of the art department. Vinycomb and Thomson's cousin, Mrs. William H. Dodd, encouraged his artistic development during the first years of his career. Thomson's artistic ambitions led him to London in 1883 where he became a leading contributor The English Illustrated Magazine. He first worked for the magazine with Randolph Caldecott on the 1885‚Äì86 issue, and later collaborated with Herbert Railton on the 1887‚Äì88 issue. His style at the time is said to be in the \\"straight tradition of Caldecott.\\" Thomson also gained praise and influenced many young artists through his book illustrations. He notably illustrated editions of William Shakespeare,See \\"The Merry Wives of Windsor by William Shakespeare with Illustrations by Hugh Thomson,\\" (London: William Heinemann, 1910). Jane Austen, and Charles Dickens. His illustrations for Elizabeth Gaskell's Cranford (1891) inspired a slew of publishers to produce a series of gift books in a similar style (\\"crown octavo with three edges gilt, bound in dark green cloth, front and spine heavily stamped in gold\\"). Between 1886 and 1900, he illustrated a set of small classics for Macmillans and Kegan Paul. Much of his work during that period consisted of elaborately illustrated gift books and reprints of popular classics. Thomson's most popular illustrations were \\"fine line drawing of rural characters and gentle countrified society.\\" His works were featured in a number of exhibitions during his lifetime, including an 1899 exhibit at the Birmingham and Midland Institute and a 1910 exhibit of his watercolor drawings for Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor at The Leicester Galleries in London.A handsome oversized volume with his paintings laid in was produced for the exhibition. See \\"The Merry Wives of Windsor by William Shakespeare with Illustrations by Hugh Thomson\\" (London: William Heinemann, 1910). His illustrations were also featured in an 1891 exhibit with fellow illustrator Kate Greenaway at the Fine Art Society. Methods An illustration from Pride and Prejudice. Thomson is best known for his pen-and-ink illustrations. He prepared most of his work in black and white until the early years of the 20th century, but would sometimes tint pieces for exhibits. The earliest known example of this was for the 1899 Birmingham and Midland Institute exhibition, where he colored the Cranford illustrations he had first drawn eight years earlier. Throughout his career Thomson occasionally dabbled with watercolors, but only used color in his illustrations in response to his publishers' demand. His first book illustrations prepared and printed fully in color were for the last two books in the Cranford series, Scenes of Clerical Life (1906) and Silas Marner (1907). When working on a new illustration, Thomson would research his subject in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. He would often take detailed notes on costumes, furniture, old prints, and architectural records. His attention to detail can be seen in his sketchbooks, which include pages devoted to the changing styles of ladies' bonnets and descriptions of \\"the details of a cavalry officer's regimentals, together with a series of studies of how such an officer would hold the reins of his mount.\\" When illustrating a series of pieces set in the same location, Thomson would maintain the details of each room, hallway, or facade, drawing them from different angles throughout the publication. Thomson was often praised for his ability to \\"project himself into a story.\\" Much of his work has become inseparable from the publications themselves. Such is the case with his illustrations for Pride and Prejudice and the other Austen novels. When J. M. Barrie's Quality Street was published with Thomson's illustrations in 1913, the art critic for the Daily News stated, \\"The Barrie-Thomson combination is as perfect in its way as that of Gilbert and Sullivan.\\" Thomson was elected RI, a member of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1897 and retired in 1907. The Cranford School Thomson was the first of the Cranford School of illustrators who abandoned the 1890s style of Beardsley for the delicacy of an eighteenth-century mode. The 'Cranford School' of illustration was not so much a 'school' with a common training, but more of a style which celebrated a sentimental, pre-industrial notion of ‚Äòold England‚Äô. The style was named for Thomson's illustrations of the Macmillan reissue of Mrs. Gaskell's Cranford. Cranford was the first of a series of 24 volumes, of which Thomson illustrated 11. Felmingham includes the Cranford School within a broader movement that he called the Wig and Powder School which he states reflected an aspect of contemporary taste that . . . is sometimes called the 'Queen Ann revival'. Felmingham included the popularity of such architectural features as high-pitched roof, Flemish gables, and white or green poainted sash windows as an outward expression of the revival. Jenkins states that the term Wig and Powder School is loosely equivalent to the Cranford School and that the latter term was mostly used between 1890 and 1914.Jenkins also notes that the school is sometime also called that Queen Anne Revival, a term especially associated with the watercolour work that sometimes accompanied the delicate pen drawings, such as Thomson's colour drawings for the 1898 Cranford, online at the British Library . The style was an nostalgic, affectionate and slightly whimsical approach to historical themes. and was distinguished by graphic nostalgia for a philistinism that was no more. The members of the school had all been fired by the literature, art, costume or atmosphere of England in the eighteenth century and became dealers in nostalgia on a very large scale. It was a style of illustration harking back to pre-industrial rural England, which specialized in the nostalgic recreation of a by-gone golden era before the ravages of industrialization. Cooke notes that the style involved the careful representation of Regency dress and interiors, pastoral settings and sharp characterization which was based on a close reading of the text. The emergence of the Cranford School style was only possible because photo-mechanical reproduction of drawings allowed the fine pen lines distinctive of the school to be reproduced, which was impossible with the older technique of wood engravings. Thomson was the originator of the school. Other members of the school were: *C. E. Brock (18701938) *H. M. Brock (18751960) *Christiana Mary Demain Hammond (18601900), who signed her work Chris Hammond. *Fred Pegram (18701937) *F. H.

It served as K√∂nigsberg's city hall from 1724 to 1927, after which it became a museum until its destruction in 1944. The town hall, or Rathaus, was located along Brodb√§nkenstra√üe. First documented in 1374, it was renovated in 1387. Political and religious disputes between the Prussian estates and ducal Prussian officials during the 1560s led to involvement by King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland, sovereign of the Duchy of Prussia. On 28 October 1566 Albert I, Duke of Prussia, had the councilors Johann Funck, Matthias Horst, and Hans Schnell beheaded at the town hall's marketplace, with Johann Steinbach and Paul Skalich fleeing the country. From 1695 to 1697 the town hall received a Baroque restyling with pilasters, bell tower, roof sculptures, and a gilded staircase with a pair of shield-holding bear statues. With the unification of Kneiphof, Altstadt, and L√∂benicht into K√∂nigsberg in 1724, the Kneiphof Town Hall was chosen as the city hall. In 1838 the building was expanded to the east with three windows. The magister's hall was decorated with a stucco roof by an unknown master. The city council met in the Junkersaal wing. Before the building was a monument of Hans von Sagan. In 1927 the city administration moved to the Stadthaus in northern K√∂nigsberg, with a few departments remaining in Kneiphof. In the same year the painter Eduard Anderson advocated for the creation of the K√∂nigsberg City Museum within the town hall, which opened in 1928. The Kneiphof Town Hall was destroyed in August 1944 during the Bombing of K√∂nigsberg in World War II.

It is a story of Aarne- Thompson type 58 (\\"The Man, the Dog, and the Bird\\"). Origin The Grimms collected the story in Zwehrn in Nederhessen. Synopsis A dog owner lets his shepherd dog starve from hunger, causing it to leave home. The dog meets a sparrow and accompanies it to the city. The bird captures meat and bread for the dog as a sign of gratitude. When they leave town, night falls, and they decide to go to sleep. During the night, a man in a horse carriage approaches the dog and sparrow. The sparrow alerts the man that he is going to run over the dog who is in the road, but he ignores the sparrow and runs over the dog nevertheless. The sparrow curses the man, announcing that he will turn into a poor man. It pecks the wine barrels the man was transporting open, so that the precious wine leaks out. The bird also pecks out the horses' eyes. When the man tries to kill the bird with an axe, he accidentally slays his own horses down. As a result, the man is forced to leave his now useless carriage behind and returns home. At home he notices that birds have eaten all his wheat. He notices the sparrow, still out on revenge, and throws his axe at him, only to smash his own windows, his stove and the rest of his household. Finally he manages to capture the bird, and his wife asks him whether he is going to strike it dead. The man feels this death is not cruel enough for the bird. He swallows it in one big bite. However, the bird still sticks its head out of the man's mouth, prompting him to let his wife take a final swing with his axe at the bird. This kills the man and the bird flies off.

It is noted for its historic Gothic Revival church building at 113 S. 9th Street, which once served as the pro-cathedral for what is now the Episcopal Diocese of Mississippi. History The Episcopal history of the area predates the incorporation of Oxford, with services held periodically throughout the 1840s. In 1848 James Hervey Otey, then provisional Bishop of Mississippi, encouraged the establishment of an Episcopal congregation there, anticipating opportunities from the recent opening of the University of Mississippi. The church was founded on May 12, 1851 with the election of its vestry and wardens. Noted scholar Rev. Prof. Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard, the first resident cleric, arrived in 1855 and began the work of building a permanent church. Land was offered by John Donelson Martin in 1850, but the lot where the church now stands was purchased in 1855 from Philip and Mary Yancey, with construction beginning that year. In 1856 Barnard was named chancellor of the university, contributing to the parish's interest in the university community. Construction on the church was completed in 1860, with Barnard delivering the first sermon on Easter that year. Barnard resigned his posts after the outbreak of the American Civil War, however, and staffing and other difficulties relating to the hostilities prevented formal consecration of the church until 1871. Bishop Coadjutor and later Bishop Hugh Miller Thompson moved into St. Peter's newly constructed original rectory in 1883, leading some to refer to St. Peter's as a cathedral or pro-cathedral, a practice that continued until at least 1889. Several high-ranking Confederates including Jacob Thompson, Francis A. Shoup, and Albert Taylor Bledsoe were members of the congregation. Nevertheless, then-rector (later bishop) Rev. Duncan M. Gray Jr. strongly supported the 1962 integration of the university, and under his leadership and that of his son, the parish became heavily involved in racial reconciliation efforts. Church The church faces west at the corner of E. Jackson Ave. and N. 9th St., three blocks west of the courthouse square. It is not known for certain who served as architect, although parish tradition holds it to be Richard Upjohn, to whose style the church does correspond in plan and detail. The church was built mainly of finely ornamented local brick on a simple nave plan, with lancet windows between buttresses. The tower in the northwest corner is topped by an octagonal spire added in 1893. It was added to the National Register in 1975.

He worked in Berlin and Charlottenburg until 1908; in 1906 he was awarded the Schinkelpreis in honor of Karl Friedrich Schinkel. In 1908 Lahrs began working at the Kunstakademie in his native K√∂nigsberg. He served as architectural professor at the Kunstakademie from 1911 to 1934. Lahrs' most prominent designs included the Kunsthalle (completed 1913) in Tragheim and the new Kunstakademie (completed 1919) after it moved to Ratshof. In 1920 Lahrs and Stanislaus Cauer designed a memorial in the Gemeindefriedhof cemetery near Rothenstein and Maraunenhof; the memorial honored 200 workers killed in a munitions explosion in Rothenstein. Lahrs also designed the new mausoleum for Immanuel Kant near K√∂nigsberg Cathedral in 1924. In the same year he designed a regimental memorial at Brandenburg Gate honoring casualties from K√∂nigsberg's foot artillery during World War I. In 1926 he led an excavation of the courtyard of K√∂nigsberg Castle. Two years later he designed the provincial finance office, the Landesfinanzamt, just outside Neurossgarten.

It is KHM nr. 63. It is classified as Aarne- Thompson-Uther ATU 402, \\"The Animal Bride\\". A second variant of the tale also collected by the Brothers Grimm is \\"The Poor Miller's Boy and the Cat\\" (Der arme M√ºllersbursch und das K√§tzchen), listed as KHM 106. Summary A king has three sons: the eldest and the middle one are brave and strong, but the youngest is gullible and na√Øve, so he is called Simpleton. One day, the king casts three feathers into the air, and when they land, each of his children should follow to see where it leads. The youngest discovers the feather has landed in a lake or pond where a toad lives that speaks in rhyme. The king asks for marvellous gifts - impossibly difficult to find, or make - for his sons to show him: a carpet, made by the finest crafstmanship and a ring of extraordinary splendour as a second gift. Simpleton manages to produce the items in front on his father, to the jealousy of his older brothers, who are against the idea that the youngest should inherit the kingdom. For a final task, the king asks for the princes to bring a woman or bride that can do acrobatics and pirouettes so fantastical that they can pass through a very small ring. The youngest presents his case to the talking toad, who orders another frog of his pond to embark into a carriage pulled by mice and to present themselves in court. When the carriage arrives, out comes a beautiful princess, who performs the impossible feat and earns the hand of the Simpleton and the kingdom. Translation The tale was sometimes translated as Dummling and the Toad in English compilations.Murray, J., Grimm, W., Grimm, J., Taylor, J. Edward., Grimm, W. (1846). The fairy ring: A new collection of popular tales. London: J. Murray. pp. 287-293 Variants The tale is widespread in folktale collections, attesting to a prince who finds a love interest in a(n/ sapient) animal of the female sex. As the story progresses, the prince - the youngest of three royal children - begins to fall in love with the magical animal, and, as his father asks for the princes to show their brides, the animal princess suggests she comes as she is. When the animal bride arrives at the palace with her fantastical carriage, pulled by other animals or dragons, she transforms into a beautiful princess. The tale type of the Prince-Animal Bride love story was very popular in the salon culture of the 17th century France, as attested by the presence of such motifs in the literary works of, for instance, Madame d'Aulnoy.Barchilon, J.

Nearby was the Wrangel Tower (Wrangelturm, named after Friedrich Graf von Wrangel), the Oberteich, and the Ostmesse. Because of its proximity to the Wrangel Tower, the art museum was also known as the Kunsthalle am Wrangelturm. Its opening exhibition in 1913 was organized by Adalbert Bezzenberger and dedicated to the Kingdom of Prussia's liberation in 1813 during the War of the Sixth Coalition. The Kunsthalle was used by the German Army's postal service during World War I; exhibitions were held instead at the K√∂nigsberg Stock Exchange. In 1924 the museum was transferred from the art association to the city. The building was damaged by Bombing of K√∂nigsberg in World War II, but survived the war. However, it fell into disuse following the change of German K√∂nigsberg to Russian Kaliningrad. It was used for storage in 1951 and as a school by 1985.

Westerhout 31 seems to be actually formed of several star-forming regions at very different distances that from our line of sight appear together: one (formed by the radio-emitting nebulae G10.2-0.3 and G10.6-0.4) at a distance of 3.3 or 4.5 kiloparsecs from the Sun and other (the radio- emitting nebula G10.3-0.1) much farther away, at a distance between 11.8 and 14.5 kiloparsecs (in the other side of the galaxy respect to the Sun, with the former distance more likely due to its stellar content). G10.3-0.1 is the most notable as it contains the star cluster 1806-20 that includes the famous luminous blue variable star LBV 1806-20, the magnetar SGR 1806-20, two blue hypergiant stars, a supergiant O star, three Wolf-Rayet stars, two of them carbon-rich, and other young, massive stars.

Some of the most common arguments and terms are discussed here. Chazakah (presumption) The term chazakah () usually refers to the default assumption; i.e. what is assumed until there is evidence to the contrary. For example, if one is known to have owned real estate, it is assumed that he still owns it until proven otherwise. However, with movable items, the chazakah lies with whoever currently has the item in his possession, not with the one who had previously owned it. This principle also applies in ritual law. For example: Food known to be kosher maintains its status until there is evidence to the contrary. Also, one who engages in acts done only by Kohanim is assumed to be a kohen himself, until proven otherwise (see Presumption of priestly descent). De'oraita and derabanan A law is de'oraita (Aramaic: ◊ì◊ê◊ï◊®◊ô◊ô◊™◊ê, \\"of the Torah,\\" i.e. scriptural) if it was given with the written Torah. A law is derabbanan (Aramaic: ◊ì◊®◊ë◊†◊ü, \\"of our rabbis,\\" Rabbinic) if it is ordained by the rabbinical sages.Promising Justice: Derrida with Jewish Jurisprudence A Hirvonen - Law and Critique, 2001 - Springer \\"Thus, those commandments (mitzvot) that come directly from the Torah (de'oraita) and are biblical, are a superior authority to those rabbinic ones which do not come from it (de'rabbanan). The de'oraita ... \\" The concepts of de'oraita and derabbanan are used extensively in Jewish law. Sometimes it is unclear whether an act is de'oraita or derabbanan. For example: the Talmud says the prohibition of reciting an unnecessary berakhah (blessing formulated with God's name) violates the verse Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.The Hebrew source text: \\"◊õ◊ú ◊î◊û◊ë◊®◊ö ◊ë◊®◊õ◊î ◊©◊ê◊ô◊†◊î ◊¶◊®◊ô◊õ◊î ◊¢◊ï◊ë◊® ◊û◊©◊ï◊ù ◊ú◊ê ◊™◊©◊ê\\" (Berachot 33a) Maimonides sees the Talmud as proving a de'oraita prohibition,Mishneh Torah, Berachot 1, 15 while Tosafot considers the law to be only derabbanan, and sees the Talmud's scriptural reference as only an asmachta (support).The Aramaic source text: \\"◊ï◊û◊©◊ï◊ù ◊ì◊û◊ë◊®◊ö ◊ë◊®◊õ◊î ◊©◊ê◊ô◊†◊î ◊¶◊®◊ô◊õ◊î ◊ï◊ß◊¢◊ë◊® ◊û◊©◊ï◊ù ◊ë◊ú ◊™◊©◊ê ◊ú◊ô◊õ◊ê ◊ì◊î◊î◊ô◊ê ◊ì◊®◊©◊î ◊ì◊®◊ë◊†◊ü\\" (Tosafot on Rosh Hashanah 33a) Examples Examples of the application of these two terms abound. Examples include: * Birkat Hamazon contains four blessings. While the first three are considered de'oraita, the fourth blessing was added much later on in Jewish history and is derabbanan.Babylonian Talmud, Brachot 45b * Regarding the verse \\"Thou shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk\\": From this, many laws of kashrut are derived by the rabbis. One might think this would make it derabbanan because it was derived by the rabbis, but the laws are actually de-'oraita because they are derived by interpreting the Torah.Chullin 104a, 113a However, the extension of this prohibition to eating chicken with milk is derabbanan, as it is the product of a specific rabbinic enactment.Mishneh Torah Hilchot Mamrim 2:9; Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 87:3. Modern observance The application of differences between rabbinic and biblical mitzvot can sometimes make practical differences. ;Rules of precedence :If a de'oraita rule comes into conflict with a d'rabbanan rule, the d'oraita rule (Torah rule) always takes precedence. ;Sofek (doubt) :In a case where it is uncertain whether a commandment applies: If the commandment is de'oraita one must follow the stricter of the two possibilities; if the commandment is derabbanan one may take the lenient position. ;Bediavad (extenuating circumstances) :In cases of extenuating circumstances regarding a derabbanan, decisors of Jewish law sometimes apply the law leniently. Kal Vachomer (A fortiori) A kal vachomer (, literally \\"lenient and strict\\") derives one law from another through the following logic: If a case that is generally strict has a particular leniency, a case that is generally lenient will certainly have that leniency. The argument can also work in reverse, and also in areas where lenient or strict might not be precisely applicable. Migo A migo (Aramaic: ◊û◊ô◊í◊ï, literally \\"out of\\" or \\"since\\") is an argument for a defendant that he ought to be believed regarding a certain claim, because he could have made a different claim which would definitely have been believed.If You Borrow from Us, Do We Not Get it Back? For example, if someone admits to having borrowed money and claims to have paid it back, he is believed because he could have claimed that he never borrowed the money in the first place (absent other evidence for the loan).Migo See also * Mitzvah#Rabbinical mitzvot * Takkanah * Talmudical hermeneutics References Category:Aramaic words and phrases Category:Jewish law principles Category:Judaism-related lists Category:Talmud concepts and terminology ","title":"List of Talmudic principles"},{"id":"37987722","text":"Othello Nelson \\"Chico\\" Renfroe (March 1, 1923 ‚Äì September 3, 1991) was an American professional baseball shortstop in the Negro Leagues and in the Mexican League.

The method is based on the estimation of the electrical conductivity or resistivity of the medium. The estimation is performed based on the measurement of voltage of electrical field induced by the distant grounded electrodes (current electrodes). Measurements Figure 1. Electrical profiling using four-electrode probes in Wenner configuration. Figure 2. Electrical profiling using four-electrode probes in Schlumberger configuration. Figure 3. Pole‚Äìdipole array profiling. Figure 4. Dipole‚Äìdipole electrode array profiling. Figures 1‚Äì4 show the possible configuration of the measurement setup. The electrodes A and B are current electrodes which are connected to a current source; N and M are potential electrodes which are used for the voltage measurements. As source, the direct current or low frequency alternating current is used. The interpretation of the measurements can be performed based on the apparent resistivity values. The depth of investigation depends on the distance between the current electrodes. In order to obtain the apparent resistivity as the function of depth, the measurements for each position are performed with several different distances between current electrodes. The apparent resistivity is calculated as : \\\\rho_k=k\\\\frac{U_{MN}}{I_{AB}} here, k is a geometric factor, {U_{MN}} ‚Äî voltage between electrodes –ú and N, {I_{AB}} ‚Äî current in the line AB. The geometric factor is defined by : k= \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\frac{1}{r_{AM}}-\\\\frac{1}{r_{BM}}-\\\\frac{1}{r_{AN}}+\\\\frac{1}{r_{BN}} } here r is the distance between electrodes.

Those who ruled in the name of her infant son James VI fought against the supporters of the Queen, who was exiled in England. Edinburgh Castle, which was garrisoned in her name, became the focus of the conflict and surrendered only after an English intervention in May 1573. The conflict in 1570 was called an \\"intestine war in the bowels of this commonwealth\\",Register Privy Council of Scotland, Addenda, vol. 14, p. 50 and the period was called soon after an \\"intestine war driven by questions against authority.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 361 no.437, English comment of 1579 referring 1568‚Äì1573: Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland, vol. 8 (1982), Latin phrase \\"tempore ultimi intestini belli nostro in regno concitani per questionem tunc contra nostram authoritatem commotam\\" referring to May 1571. Queen's men and King's men The supporters of Queen Mary had popular international support for what was seen as the legitimate cause of supporters of an unjustly deposed monarch. The King's party claimed that their cause was a war of religion, like that in France, and that they were fighting for the Protestant cause. Mary had escaped from her imprisonment in Lochleven Castle to join her main supporters in the west of Scotland, but they were defeated at the Battle of Langside by her half-brother James Stewart, earl of Moray. Mary went to England. The Earl of Moray was Regent of Scotland and ruled with a council of regency. Mary had depended on the support of the Hamilton family at Langside, and existing rivalries with Hamiltons partly determined who came to join her side. Other supporters of the Queen objected to Moray as a ruler.Lynch, Michael, Scotland, A New History (Pimlico, 1991), pp. 221-2. Regent Moray marches west and north Moray moved against the supporters of Queen Mary in their south-west power base with a military expedition in June 1568 called the 'Raid of Dumfries' or 'Raid of Hoddom.' The Regent's army with the royal artillery marched to Biggar, where his allies were commanded to muster on 10 June, and on to Dumfries. Biggar was the home area of Lord Fleming who had declared on behalf of Mary. The King's army was protected by a scouting party led by Alexander Hume of Manderston, the vanguard was commanded by the Earl of Morton and Lord Hume. Behind was the \\"carriage\\", namely the artillery train, followed by Moray himself. The Laird of Cessford followed, and the army was flanked by the scouting parties of the lairds of the Merse and Buccleuch. Along the way Moray captured castles belonging to Mary's supporters, including Lord Fleming's castle of Boghall, as well as Skirling Castle, Crawford Castle, Sanquhar Castle, Kenmure Castle, and Hoddom Castle, where the cannon were deployed, and Annan where he rendezvoused with Lord Scrope, the Captain of Carlisle Castle, to discuss border matters. Scrope estimated the Regent's army at 6,000 men. He then returned to Carlisle where he saw Queen Mary's servants play football on 14 June. Moray then took Lochmaben Castle, which the Laird of Drumlanrig was left to hold, and then captured Lochwood and Lochhouse before returning to Edinburgh via Peebles. At Dumfries, a number of Lord Maxwell's supporters surrendered.Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1970), pp. 128‚Äì134: Holinshed, Raphael, Chronicles: Scotland, vol. 5 (London, 1808), 634: Bannatyne Miscellany, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1827), pp. 23-29: CSP. Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), nos. 700, 703, 716, 717. Moray was responsible for the destruction of Rutherglen castle, which he burned to the ground in 1569 in retribution against the Hamiltons for having supported Mary at Langside. In June 1569 Moray went north to Brechin where he accepted hostages sent by the Earl of Huntly, then on to Aberdeen where he held talks with Huntly himself. At Inverness, on 4 June 1569, Moray met the Highland and island chiefs along with the Earls of Caithness and Sutherland and Lord Lovat. His secretary, John Wood, said that \\"such a power had seldom been seen there\\"; Moray wrote that \\"the journey is to put down troubles in the north.\\"CSP. Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 652 no. 1072, 653 no. 1075 Queen's men at Dumbarton The supporters of the exiled Queen were in possession of Dumbarton Castle, a fortress and port that commanded the Clyde. The castle was held for Mary by Lord Fleming, helped by other \\"Queen's men\\" including his relation, the Captain of Biggar, and Lord Sempill, who stocked the castle with provisions from the surrounding countryside. It was rumoured that armed support for Mary would land there; in December 1569, William Drury, Marshall of Berwick, heard that the Spanish Duke of Alva was sending troops there from Flanders. The Regent Moray declared that he would explore all means to take the Castle and would have taken it in May 1569, if he had then had the opportunity to take his army west; > \\"Towards Dumbarton, I leif na moyen unsocht to obteyn it, and doubt not, > befoir May to have had the same, gif I mycht have reparit to the west > countrie my selff.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), > pp. 21, 27, 28. The Spanish troops did not materialise, but the \\"King's men\\" did not take Dumbarton Castle until April 1571. George Buchanan, a contemporary historian and polemicist for the King's party gave an account of the fall of Dumbarton. According to his account, a soldier of the garrison deserted after Lord Fleming had had his wife whipped as a thief. The deserter met Robert Douglas, a relation of the Regent Lennox, and John Cunningham of Drumquhassle and discussed with them ways of capturing the castle. The deserter promised to take the castle with a small band of soldiers. The chronicle Historie of King James the Saxt tells this part of the story differently, having Douglas and Drumquhassle setting out to recruit the former member of the garrison whose name was Robesoun.Thomas Thomson, ed, Historie of King James Saxt (Edinburgh, 1825), pp. 69‚Äì70. The Privy Council of the Regent adopted the plan for a small-scale assault, to be led by Thomas Crawford of Jordanhill, and set the date for this as 1 April. Crawford only informed his men of their objective the night before the attack, at Dumbuck Hill, a mile from Dumbarton. Dumbarton Castle controlling the Clyde was held by Mary's supporters until April 1571 Crawford marched on the castle before daybreak, first encountering the obstacle of a broken bridge and a scare caused by the sight of a will-o'-the- wisp. While they were helped by the mist, their scaling ladders proved unwieldy. When all was going well, one of the soldiers froze on the ladder and had to be tied to it so the others could pass. At the top of the hill Alexander Ramsay was first over the inner wall. Three garrison sentinels spotted him and his two companions and pelted them with rocks, but Alexander killed them. Behind Alexander, the old wall collapsed, allowing the rest of the King's men to enter. According to Buchanan, they shouted \\"A Darnley, A Darnley,\\" and the garrison scattered. Lord Fleming escaped, but John Fleming, Captain of Boghall (or Biggar), John Hamilton, Archbishop of St Andrews, Verac a French diplomat who had arrived with munitions, Alexander Master of Livingstone, and an Englishman named Johnson were captured. The Regent Lennox came to view the castle. Verac and the Englishmen were released, Fleming of Boghall was imprisoned, and the Archbishop was taken to Stirling and hanged.Aikman, James, translated, George Buchanan's History of Scotland, vol.2, Blackie, Glasgow (1827), pp. 592‚Äì599: CSP. Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), p. 552, 'lewd subject named Johnson taken at Dumbarton.' In September 1571, cannon from Dumbarton were taken to Edinburgh to use against the Queen's men who had built a barricade across the High Street there and were holding Edinburgh Castle on behalf of the deposed Queen.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), p. 707 War comes to Edinburgh Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, painted by Jean Clouet Edinburgh Castle was initially delivered by its Captain, James Balfour, to the Regent Moray, who appointed Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange as its Keeper. Grange was a trusted lieutenant of the Regent, but after Moray's murder in January 1570 his allegiance to the King's cause wavered. After the capture of Dumbarton Castle by the King's men in April 1571, Grange changed sides, occupying the castle and town for Queen Mary against the new Regent, the Earl of Lennox. There now followed what became known as the \\"Lang Siege\\", from the Scots word for \\"long\\".Potter (2003), p.56 Hostilities began at the end of April, after Grange arrested the Provost of Edinburgh, James MacGill of Nether Rankeillour. The period has become termed \\"the War between Leith and Edinburgh\\" because the Earl of Morton and the King's army based themselves in Leith.Lynch, Michael, Edinburgh and Reformation (John Donald, 1981), pp. 125‚Äì152, 'The Wars between Leith and Edinburgh' On 22 April two Marian supporters, Arthur Hamilton of Merrynton and Alexander Baillie of Lamington, captured the king's tailor James Inglis near St Cuthbert's Church. He was returning from Stirling Castle, where he had been fitting the king's clothes. Inglis was released two days later after the Deacon of Crafts had spoken with Kirkcaldy. Kirkcaldy now began to strengthen the castle defences and work began on the spur fortification.Memoriales of Transactions in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1836) p. 111-2. The first clash of arms came in May with a chance encounter at the \\"Lousie-Law\\", a hill on the Burgh Muir within sight of Edinburgh Castle. This was followed by a month-long siege of the town of Edinburgh by the King's party, and a short second siege in October. On 13 May, the King's men built a small artillery redoubt for three cannon on the \\"Dow Craig\\" of the Calton Hill above Trinity College Kirk, which was attacked the same night.Thomson, ed., Diurnal, p.213 The King's party gathered in the Canongate in a meeting known as the \\"creeping parliament\\", from their attempts to assemble inconspicuously, on 14‚Äì16 May, while Mary's supporters met in the tolbooth.Lynch (1981), p. 131. The blockade of the castle and skirmishing continued, with another clash of arms in the grounds of Craigmillar Castle on 2 June 1571 and at the Gallow Hill of Leith (modern Shrubhill) on 10 June 1571. On 26 June, known subsequently as \\"Black Saturday\\", the Earl of Morton brought his soldiers to Hawkhill at Restalrig, which provoked Grange to bring his men out to the Quarry Holes (where present-day Easter Road meets Abbey Mount). Morton's men pursued them back to the Water Gate at the eastern end of the Canongate.Historie James Sext (Edinburgh, 1804), pp. 132‚Äì134 In July, the King's men garrisoned the Palace of Holyroodhouse and Grange responded on 25 July by placing guns in an entrenchment at the \\"Black Friar Yard\\" (the modern High School Yards) to shoot at the palace.Thomas Thomson, ed, Diurnal of Occurrents (Edinburgh, 1833), pp.232, 234. Attempts were made to supply Grange and the Castle from France and George, Lord Seton, negotiated for support with Duke of Alba in the Spanish Netherlands. In July 1571, John Chisholm, controller of the royal artillery, was captured after setting out from Dieppe with money from the exiled Bishop of Glasgow, cannonballs of four different calibres, and pikes. He was arrested by Patrick, Lord Lindsay, but managed to pass some of the money to Grange. Although Chisholm was taken at North Queensferry it was thought he had intended to capture Tantallon Castle, linking up with Mary's supporters who unsuccessfully attacked the castle on 2 July 1571.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.3 (Edinburgh, 1903), pp. 529, 532‚Äì523, 535, 620‚Äì621, 623‚Äì624, 636 At this time, Grange began to the demolish houses at the top of the Canongate close to the Netherbow Port (town gate), to create an open killing ground.Reid, David, ed., David Hume of Godscroft' History of the House of Angus, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 2005), p.198, 200, 202: Lynch, (1981), p. 132. Grange's men, now being called the \\"Castilians\\" demolished more houses from February 1572 onwards. The timber from the houses was used as fuel that was needed because the King's forces had sabotaged the coal mines, but the demolitions continued into the summer. The Castilians seem to have been trying to extort loans from the wealthy burgesses who had resorted to Leith, and as many as 50 houses were dismantled by the \\"Captain of the Chimneys.\\" Grange was more successful in raising money from loans on the security of the crown jewels, which were \\"laid in wed and pledge\\" with wealthy merchants and aristocratic allies. Subsequently, an inquest found that two merchants who loaned large sums to the Queen's party had been personal friends of Moray and John Knox.Lynch, (1981), 138-9, 145, 147 Civil war in the north Meanwhile, in the north of Scotland, Adam Gordon of Auchindoun, brother of the Earl of Huntly, fought for the Queen. Regent Mar encouraged the Clan Forbes who had long feuded with the Gordons in Aberdeenshire to fight for him. Gordon's force was attacked by the Forbes, commanded by Black Arthur Forbes, at the battle of Tillieangus on 10 October 1571, and the Forbes were defeated. Mar sent an army commanded by Captains Chisholm and Wedderburn northwards, and the Earl of Huntly sent a force north from Edinburgh with orders to \\"offend the Forbeses all they can.\\"CSP. Scotland, vol.4 (1905), p.43, Huntly's men travelled north with James Kirkcaldy. The Forbes were again defeated when they marched against the Gordons at Aberdeen at the battle of Craibstone on 20 November 1571, and Arthur Forbes was killed. The son of Lord Forbes was imprisoned at Huntly Castle.CSP. Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), p.67. Soldiers sent to support Adam Gordon were captured at Cramond Bridge in 1572 and executed One of Adam Gordon's men, Captain Thomas Ker, was sent to demand the surrender of Corgarff Castle. Adam ordered the castle to be burnt with its occupants, thirty-eight members of the family including Margaret Forbes, Lady Towie. This incident is recalled in \\"The ballad of Edom o‚ÄôGordon.\\"Guthrie, William, History of Scotland, vol.7 (Edinburgh, 1768), pp. 358-361, following Crawford's Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland, and the Historie of James Sext. Gordon then marched on Montrose and forced the town to submit to him and give him ¬£2000 and two tuns of wine.CSP. Scotland, vol.4 (1905), pp. 348-50: Historie James Sext Also at this time Broughty Castle was captured by a Queen's man, the Laird of Parbroath, apparently by a trick or \\"slight.\\" Broughty was delivered back to the Regent in April 1572.CSP. Scotland, vol.4 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 236. On 24 April 1572, another attempt was made to send soldiers north from Edinburgh to fight for Adam Gordon in the Queen's cause. The men were to have embarked from Blackness Castle but were forced to surrender at Cramond Bridge to a much larger force of horse and foot commanded by the Earl of Morton. Fifteen of the prisoners \\"denudit of their weapons\\" were executed, and the remaining five men were taken to Leith and hanged. According to the anti-Morton chronicle Historie of James the Sext, this \\"forme of law\\" was called the \\"Dowglas Warres.\\"Historie James Sext, (1804), pp. 167‚Äì168, the skirmish took place at \\"the new brigg besyd Edinburgh on the west hand\\", the bridge over the Almond at Cramond: incident described CSP. Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 255 no.268 Adam Gordon was besieging the House of Glenbervie in the Mearns in July 1572, when he encountered and defeated the King's army at Brechin. Last year of the Lang Siege Niddry Castle, about 11 miles west of Edinburgh, was held for the Queen by Lord Seton. According to the Historie of James the Sext, when Niddry was attacked, in April and June 1572, the garrison of Edinburgh Castle supported Niddry by carrying out a diversionary attack on Merchiston Castle which was being held for the King.Thomson, Thomas, ed., The Historie of James the Sext (Bannatyne Club, 1825), pp. 105-7 The King's party appealed to Elizabeth I of England for assistance, as they lacked the artillery and money required to reduce Edinburgh Castle, and feared that Grange would receive aid from France. Elizabeth sent ambassadors to negotiate, and in July 1572 a truce was agreed and the blockade lifted. The town was effectively surrendered to the King's party, with Grange confined to the castle.Potter, (2003), p.105 The truce expired on 1 January 1573 and Grange began bombarding the town. His supplies of powder and shot, however, were running low, and despite having 40 cannon available, there were only seven gunners in the garrison.Potter, (2003) p.131 The King's forces, under the new Regent, the Earl of Morton, progressed plans for a siege. Trenches were dug to surround the castle and St Margaret's Well, one of its main sources of water, was poisoned.Potter, (2003), pp. 121‚Äì122 Peace talks involving the English diplomat Henry Killigrew and the Queen's party resulted in the \\"Pacification of Perth\\" on 15 February 1573, and after the Earl of Huntly had met Morton at Aberdour Castle, all Queen Mary's other supporters in Scotland surrendered to Morton except Grange and the Castilians. Grange resolved to continue in the Castle, despite water shortages. With him remained William Maitland of Lethington, Mary's former secretary, his brother John Maitland, Alexander Lord Home, Robert Melville of Murdocairnie, Robert Crichton Bishop of Dunkeld, Robert Logan of Restalrig, and the Castle's Governor, Henry Echlin of Pittadro.Hewitt, George R., Scotland under Morton, 1572-80 (John Donald, 2003), pp. 25‚Äì27. The garrison continued to bombard the town, killing a number of citizens. They also made sorties to set fires, burning 100 houses in the town, and then firing on anyone attempting to put out the flames.Potter, (2003), p. 125. Some townspeople, like Robert Moubray moved to Leith, and set up an alternative Edinburgh burgh council there. In April, a force of around 1,000 English troops, led by William Drury, arrived in Edinburgh. They were followed by 27 cannon from Berwick-upon-Tweed, including one that had been cast within Edinburgh Castle and previously captured by the English at Flodden.Potter, p.131 Drury's men built a battery on the Castle Hill, facing its eastern defences, and five other batteries to the north, west, and south. Some of the trenches were made by a Scottish workforce directed by their overseer John Scarlat.Charles Thorpe McInnes, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1566-1574, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1970), p. 350. By 17 May the batteries were ready, and the bombardment began, lasting 12 days with the guns expending around 3,000 shots.Potter, (2003), p. 137. The castle guns returned fire with \\"hot shooting\\" and on 21 May Drury had to encourage his terrified gunners by firing the cannons himself.Calendar State Papers Scotland vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), pp. 567-8 On 26 May, the English attacked and captured the Spur, the outer fortification of the castle. The following day, Grange emerged from the castle, having called a ceasefire to allow a surrender to be negotiated. When it was made clear that he would not be allowed to go free even after a surrender, Grange resolved to continue the resistance, but the garrison threatened to mutiny. Grange negotiated for Drury and his men to come into the castle on 28 May, surrendering to the English rather than to Regent Morton.Potter, (2003), pp. 139‚Äì140 Edinburgh Castle was handed over to George Douglas of Parkhead, the Regent's brother, and most of the garrison were allowed to go free. Drury took the leaders to Leith and after a week handed them to Regent Morton. William Kirkcaldy of Grange, his brother James, with the two jewellers James Mossman and James Cockie who had been minting coins in Mary's name inside the castle, were hanged at the Cross in Edinburgh on 3 August.Potter, p. 146: Robert Pitcairn, Ancient Criminal Trials, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1883), pp. 45-46: CSP. Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 604, no. 713. Mary's jewels Ten years after these events, the English diplomat Thomas Randolph wrote to Francis Walsingham to certify that Drury had found Mr Archibald Douglas a \\"fit instrument\\" to secretly negotiate with Grange, William Maitland of Lethington, Robert Melville, and others, especially to persuade them to surrender the castle. Randolph noted that Drury and Archibald were involved in the sale of Mary's jewels for cash and loans raised against them. Grange's accounts regarding Mary's jewels survived the siege.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1581-1583, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), pp. 134-5: National Records of Scotland, E35/11. Drury took the chest of remaining jewels from the castle to Leith after the siege, and most of Mary's jewels were returned to him and Mr Archibald there.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 4, p. 584: Joseph Robertson, Inventaires (Edinburgh, 1863), pp. cl-cli: HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 2, pp. 56-7. England's involvement Glasgow Cathedral, and the Castle captured by the King's party in April 1571, by John Slezer, (1693) Sir William Drury commanded two English missions in Scotland, by an unknown artist Regent Moray and his secretary John Wood tried to gain English support by producing the Casket letters in England, which were intended to incriminate Mary in the death of Lord Darnley. Moray also raised money in London by selling items from the royal jewels, including what was claimed to be a unicorn horn.Labanoff, A., Lettres de Marie Stuart, vol.7 (Dolman: London, 1844), pp. 132‚Äì134. Queen Elizabeth and her advisors were at first reluctant to intervene but their actions, and support of Moray, served to prevent reconciliation in Scotland.Boyd, William K., ed., Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), p.xi The Regent Moray was assassinated in January 1570 by a member of the Hamilton family. Elizabeth sent an army into Scotland in May 1570, which reached Glasgow, where the Queen's party were besieging Glasgow Castle. The army was commanded by the Earl of Sussex from Berwick, its leader in Scotland was William Drury, styled \\"Captain General.\\" The Earl of Lennox was in their company, arriving at Edinburgh on 14 May 1570. The Marian lords abandoned their siege of Glasgow Castle before the English arrived on 18 May, and returned to their homelands, the Hamiltons to Arran and Craignethan Castle, and Drury attempted a siege of Dumbarton Castle.CSP. Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1902), pp. 173‚Äì185. For Elizabeth's foreign policy this intervention had the effect of making France and Spain less likely to offer tangible pro-Marian support.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.3 (Edinburgh, 1903), p. xii-xiii. After the Rising of the North and the discovery of the Ridolfi plot which further damaged Mary's reputation, Regent Mar and James Douglas, Earl of Morton were able to broker the deployment of an English army against Mary's supporters at Edinburgh Castle.Cameron, Annie, Warrender Papers, vol.1, SHS (1931), pp. 104‚Äì111, 115: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), pp. 47‚Äì48, 52‚Äì54. The English diplomat Henry Killigrew worked on the reconciliation of the Scottish nobility at Perth in February 1572, where many promised not to support Mary as Queen.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 36-21 no. 437. The fall of Edinburgh Castle concluded the civil war. Diplomacy, propaganda, and the elective theory of Scottish monarchy Mary's secretary, John Lesley, Bishop of Ross maintained a daily correspondence to canvass for her release and enlist support for her cause. George Seton, 7th Lord Seton made unsuccessful attempts to acquire Spanish soldiers to fight in Scotland. Seton was given a commission by the Duke of Ch√¢tellerault, the Earl of Huntly and the Earl of Argyll to treat with the Duke of Alba, Viceroy of Lower Germany, as Mary's ambassador in August 1570.Cameron, Annie I., The Warrender Papers, vol. 1, SHS (1931), 98-9: CSP. Scotland, vol. 3, no. 408. Seton became involved with Elizabeth's exiles. In September 1570, Lord Morley met him in the household of Katherine Neville, Countess of the exiled Earl of Northumberland at Bruges. Seton told Morley that he had come to escort the Countess, who had previously sought refuge in Scotland, to France.HMC, Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House, vol. 1 (London, 1883), p. 483 nos. 1517‚Äì1518. The Historie and Life of James the Sext recorded what must have been a popular account of the mission to the Duke of Alba. Seton tried to convince him to provide an army of 10,000 men by persuading Scottish soldiers fighting against Spain in the Netherlands to change sides. However, Alba could not spare the men, and Seton only received a promise of financial support. Still trying to subvert the Scottish soldiers, he was captured and tortured on the rack. The Scottish soldiers then mutinied until he was released.Historie and Life of James the Sext, Bannatyne Club (1825), 61-63: See also HMC Salisbury, vol. 1 (London, 1883), p. 324 no. 1070, a Flemish receipt to Seton for the exchange of 10,000 crowns each of 40 stuivers, of uncertain date, calendared as (?1565). The King's party also wrote a number of letters and took initiatives to increase their following and secure aid from England.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.3 (1903), preface p.i Amidst the opportunities for disinformation, when uncertain news of the capture of Dumbarton reached London in April 1571, the English diplomat Thomas Randolph reported John Lesley pretending that Dunbar Castle had fallen, a fortress-port on the opposite coast of Scotland which had little significance in the war since Moray's parliament had ordered it to be demolished in December 1567. The Earl of Shrewsbury wrote that Mary herself seemed to discount the loss of Dumbarton in her conversation, but had suffered a loss of appetite after hearing the news.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 3 (1903), pp.526, 552 In Scotland, news and opinion was circulated in the form of printed ballads which satirised the characters and actions of the leaders of the opposing parties. Lord Fleming's defence of Dumbarton for Mary was satirized in a ballad The tressoun of Dumbertane, printed in Edinburgh by Robert Lekprevik in May 1570.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 3, (1903), 177: The tressoun of Dumbarton, 15 May, Robert Lekprevik, Edinburgh, 1570. The verses, attributed to Robert Sempill, describe Fleming's failed ambush of the English commander William Drury.Cranstoun, James, Satirical Poems of the Reformation, vol. 1 (1892) pp. 170‚Äì173, & notes vol. 2 (1893), pp. 113‚Äì117: for the incident, see Holinshed, vol. 4 (180), p. 245 Another ballad, an Answeir to the Englisch Ballad, criticised Regent Mar, the Earl of Morton and colleagues for the rendition of the Earl of Northumberland to England after the Rising of the North;Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland was returned to England for execution > Thocht sum have playit Judas' pairt, > In selling gud Northumberland, > Quhy sould the whoill, for thair desert, > That faine wald have that fact withstand? > Or yit the countrey beir the blame? > Let thame that sauld him have the schame. > > Mar, and the divelishe Douglassis, > And namelie, Morton and Lochlevin, (Robert Douglas of Lochleven) > Mackgill and Orknay, Scottisch assis, (Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney)) > And Cleisch quhom to the gold wes gevin, (Robert Colville, Laird of Cleish) > Dunfermling that the py prepaird, (Robert Pitcairn, Commendator of > Dunfermline: \\"pie prepared\\" plotted) > And lowse Lindsay quho was his gaird, > These onlie wer the Judassis.Cranstoun, James, Satirical Poems of the > Reformation, vol. 1 (1892), pp. 244‚Äì245: see Dictionary of the Older > Scottish Tongue The ballad accurately identified Robert Colville of Cleish as the principle broker for delivering Northumberland to Berwick and his subsequent execution.CSP. Scotland, vol.4 (1905), nos. 279, 313 After the Ridolphi plot was made public in 1571, George Buchanan's short anti-Marian narrative, describing the death of Lord Darnley, the Detectio, Ane Detectioun, and Detection of Mary Stewart were published in London and St Andrews in Latin and Scots. The Detection included some of the text of the casket letters.Wormald, Jenny, Mary, Queen of Scots (1988), p. 188. Later histories retained the bias of the antagonists. In France in these years, despite much sympathy for Mary in Catholic court and Guisian circles, there were no publications in her support, probably because it was foreseen they would damage diplomatic relations with England. The first printed work to champion her cause was the anonymous L'Innocence de Marie Roine d'Ecosse (Reims, 1573). This was a response to the publication in London of a French version of George Buchanan's arguments against Mary, the Histoire de Marie Royne d'Ecosse & l'Aduterie commis avec le Comte de Bothwell, and L'Innocence sought to discredit the late Regent Moray's actions and his faction in Scotland. L'Innocence, however only ran to two editions. A French Protestant, Huguenot, response came later with Le Reveille-Matin, attributed to Nicolas Barnaud and printed in Latin, Dutch and German and French in 1575. This work situated Mary with her Guise relatives and vilified them and called for her execution.Alexander S. Richardson, Mary Queen of Scots and French Public Opinion: 1542--1600 (Palgrave, 2004), pp. 62-67, 88-98. After the execution of Queen Mary, Adam Blackwood wrote the Martyre de la Royne d'Escosse, Douairiere de France (1587) which painted an unflattering picture of Regent Moray as a scheming fox and of Regent Morton, who he said was cursed by his own father as an infant after eating a toad.A Translation of Adam Blackwood's History of Mary Queen of Scots (Maitland Club, 1834) The late 16th-century narrative Historie of King James Sext, a major source for the civil war, sometimes attributed to John Colville (first published selectively in 1706 by David Crawford of Drumsoy and in full in 1804) was sympathetic to the Hamiltons and hostile to the Regents.M.L., ed., Historie James Sext (1804), p.vi. Debate on the nature of Scottish monarchy After the civil had ended, and while Mary remained captive, full- length books were published, not only setting out the context and events of the struggle, but examining the historical and theoretical aspects of monarchical rule in Scotland. George Buchanan wrote De Jure Regni apud Scotos (The Law of Kingship Amongst the Scots) (1579) and, as a sympathiser of the Queen's party, David Chambers of Ormond published the Histoire Abbregee de tous les Roys de France, Angleterre et Escosse, Paris (1579). These works, like Buchanan's History of Scotland (1572), retold the stories of ancient Scottish Kings, many mythical who had been deposed justly or unjustly by their subjects, and might be compared with Mary.Williamson, Arthur H., Scottish National Consciousness in the Age of James VI, John Donald, (1979), pp. 117‚Äì139 Both Buchanan and Chambers were patriotic writers and shared a view of Scottish kingship drawn largely from myth, that the Scots had been a migrant people from Scythia who had elected their first king, Fergus I, in response to a crisis, 251 years after their arrival in Scotland.Williamson, Arthur H., (1979), pp. 119‚Äì120, citing Chambers, Histoire (1579), section 'Singularitez', f.13a: see also Chambers (1830), p.3, from the Chronicle. The historian Roger A. Mason describes the central premiss of Buchanan's De Jure Regni, which is at odds with ideas of absolute monarchy; > Buchanan expounded a theory of popular sovereignty whose central premiss was > that kings were appointed by the people to perform on their behalf a set of > well-defined functions. It followed that if they failed to carry out their > duties satisfactorily, thereby breaking the contract entered into by terms > of their coronation oath, the people had the right to depose them in favour > of someone more able to fulfil the duties of the royal office. Monarchy, in > short, was an elective form of government and kings were accountable to > those who elected them.Mason, Roger A., ed., 'George Buchanan, James VI and > the presbyterians', in Scots and Britons, CUP /Folger (1994), p.116 Buchanan wrote that \\"wicked kings, so often as they intended tyranny over their subjects, were restrained\\" insisting that in his day a similar custom persisted in the election of Clan Chiefs among the Highlanders or \\"Old Scots\\".De jure regni apud Scotos: A dialogue concerning the due privilege of government in the kingdom of Scotland betwixt George Buchanan and Thomas Maitland (London, 1689), p.43 The same legend had already been used by Mary's adherents to opposite effect. In December 1569, a supporter of Mary, perhaps John Lesley, had argued that the election of Fergus I and the resultant nature of Scottish kingship meant that the Scottish parliament could not have been competent to accept Mary's abdication.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), pp. 16‚Äì17 Buchanan's views would later be described as monarchomachic by the Scottish jurist William Barclay. James VI rejected Buchanan's position and attempted to have his works censored. In September 1583, he dismissed advice given by Francis Walsingham in person, saying he was an \\"absolute King.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.6 (1910), p.603 no.628, Walsingham to Elizabeth, 11 Sept. 1583 Contemporary Marian writers, including Adam Blackwood, argued that Buchanan's views reflected more the conditions and institutions of Ancient Rome rather than Scotland at any period, and that the elective aspect of Scotland's monarchy ended with the initial binding oath of allegiance of the Scottish people to Fergus I and his successors.Burns, J. H., 'George Buchanan and the anti-monarchomachs', in Mason ed., Scots & Britons (1994), pp. 149‚Äì151.

Resettlement of the island started on 14 December 2008 to inhabit the displaced residents of Kandholhudhoo (Raa Atoll) who were the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The challenging task of resettling the tsunami victims and establishing a new island community on Dhuvaafaru was undertaken by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies under an agreement made with the Government of Maldives in May 2005. Though Dhuvaafaru was uninhabited until recent history, there is physical and literary proof of the island being inhabited over 200 years ago. The famous wartime hero Dhandahelu ‚Äî depicted in story of Maldives independence war against Portuguese invasion in 17th Century ‚Äî is named after this island and is referred to in the historical literature as Dhuvaafaru Dhandahelu (meaning Dhandahelu from Dhuvaafaru). History Etymology In the local Maldivian Dhivehi language, the island name of Dhuvaafaru is literally translated as \\"running reef\\". It is suggested that this name may have been derived from the ever-shifting shape of the island‚Äôs beach in different monsoons. Even today the shape of the beach and shoreline keeps changing consistently, especially during the rainy season. Early history There is historical evidence that Dhuvaafaru was populated around 15th Century and it may have been populated as late as 200 years ago. A famous associate of the Maldivian national hero Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam hails from Dhuvaafaru. This associate is popularly known as Dhuvaafaru Dhandahelu. According to Maldivian historical sources, Dhuvaafaru Dhandahelu was a young boy from the island of Dhuvaafaru who fought with Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam to free Maldives from the occupation of Portuguese. In traditional stories Dhuvaafaru Dhandahelu is portrayed as a vigilant and valiant person. Even today there are signs of previous in-habitation of the island. On August 2005 an ancient area was discovered while trees were being cleared to make way for roads. This site sits on the south east side of Raa Atoll School. The cemetery, well and coral stone structure found from this location were officially protected as a place of historical significance. But little to none has been done to protect the area which is again concealed by wilderness. There was an old well which could be over 100 or more years, right next to the current football ground. The top of this well was renovated by the islanders of Maakurathu with cement but the bottom of the well was built using limestone; the ancient building material. However, the top of this well is now destroyed after a motor accident. It is believed that the previous residents of Dhuvaafaru, left the island due to soil erosion and its less proximity to fishing grounds. Some folktales claim that Dhuvaafaru was abandoned because the island was haunted. Elders of Kandholhudhoo claim that their ancestors were from Dhuvaafaru and other such islands across the atoll. They migrated to Kandholhudhoo because it was closer to the wider sea where fish is abundant. Repopulation of the island =Kandholhudhoo predicament= Even before the tsunami annihilated Kandholhudhoo, living conditions in the island were deplorable due to extreme congestion and matters grew worse due to an explosive rise in population. The largest population of Raa Atoll was cramped in the smallest inhabited island of the atoll. To address the issues government decided to start a land reclamation project of Kandholhudhoo lagoon. The lagoon was so small in size; the whole project was doomed from the start as it was impossible to provide any remedy for lack of land. This was a political move to appease a large population center rather than a coherent step to address the real issues. The reclamation of the lagoon destroyed the house reef which protected the island. The houses of the island were less than 20 feet away from the open sea. Thus, the island became a basin in the middle of the ocean and water poured from all directions as there was no reef to protect the island from waves and tidal rise. During the rainy season, the island was badly flooded, worsening already a tough scenario. Millions of Ruffiya were spent on this reclamation project but not one single house was built on the land reclaimed. Overcrowded island of Kandholhudhoo before the 2004 tsunami struck. There were muted and unsubstantial discussions among a handful of Kandholhudhoo natives for a move to a larger island. However, these views were hushed and met with contempt by the majority of the residents due to their ancestral and emotional attachment to the island. Though land was scarce and living conditions were difficult in Kandholhudhoo, the residents of the island enjoyed a good economic subsistence, due to a generous supply of fish and close proximity to fishing areas. This is a main factor for the skepticism of the residents to the idea of migrating elsewhere. However, tsunami brought a natural end to the reluctance of the Kandholhudhoo people to migrate. =Selection of Dhuvaafaru= Even after the tsunami hit, there were a number of residents who wanted to continue living in Kandholhudhoo though it was not practical as the tsunami has rendered the island dilapidated. Some residents pushed towards a move to an uninhabited island called Ifuru in the same atoll, while a minority wanted a move to Hulhumale'. However, majority of the people were of the opinion that they wanted to stay in the same atoll. In early 2005 a meeting was held at Ungoofaaru where the majority of Kandholhudhoo people were residing. A delegation from the government and tsunami victims from Kandholhudhoo participated in this meeting. The residents were asked to submit the names of the islands which they were considering for migration. The names of Dhuvaafaru and Ifuru were discussed and majority voted for Dhuvaafaru as their choice. Contrary to some reports Dhuvaafaru was chosen after discussion with majority of the Kandholhudhoo people, though not everyone. This was the reason why the government chose Dhuvaafaru after some studies from Disaster Management Section. Dhuvaafaru was a popular but not the most rational and well thought- out choice. There were questions about the island being vulnerable environmentally. There were serious concerns about how Dhuvaafaru will accommodate governments pledge of a \\"safe island\\", since it is a very low- lying island with history of soil erosion. =Redevelopment= Dhuvaafaru was finalized as the new home for the Kandholhudhoo people who were scattered across at least five different islands of the atoll, some lived in islands even further away like Hulhumal√©. Neighboring islanders came to the rescue of Kandholhudhoo natives during the tsunami and provided shelter to the tsunami victims until the government built temporary shelters for the tsunami victims. In an agreement made by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies with the government of Maldives in May 2005, they pledged to fund the construction of 562 houses and other necessary buildings and facilities for a community to flourish.http://www.miadhu.com/2008/09/local- news/ifrcs-hands-over-community-buildings-on-dhuvaafaru-7682/ All together 600 houses were constructed in Dhuvaafaru; 38 of which were funded by the government. International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies committed to fund over 30 million US Dollars for Dhuvaafaru project. Telecommunications tower in Dhuvaafaru. An agreement was signed between Maldivian government and the joint venture companies of Amin Construction of Maldives and Singapore‚Äôs Liang Beng to develop Dhuvaafaru on 13 February 2006. The bidding process was marred by allegation of corruption and it took over a year to finalise the contractors. Corruption allegations were brought against Amin Constructions by another local company called Moreway Constructions with regards to the bidding process. On 17 November 2005, the government revoked the contract of US$17.4 million awarded to the joint venture companies Arun Excello of India and Apollo Holdings of Maldives saying that the bidding documents were incomplete but the government failed to provide an explanation as to why the bid was accepted in the first place. Previously the government had promised in 2005 to provide permanent shelter for the displaced within two years however, over a year was wasted in the bidding process and it took an agonising four years for the tsunami victims dreams to be realised. Construction work in Dhuvaafaru started on April 2006 and the building of a new community was completed in over 2 years. While the construction was ongoing IFRC provided Kandholhudhoo residents the opportunity of visiting Dhuvaafaru once a month and inspect the progress. IFRC representatives continued consultation with the displaced people in various islands of Raa Atoll with regards to Dhuvaafaru project. On 31 August 2008 IFRC handed over the pre-school, primary school, secondary school, auditorium and community administrative building to the government after work was completed.http://www.miadhu.com/2008/09/local-news/ifrcs-hands-over-community- buildings-on-dhuvaafaru-7682 =Resettlement= Dhuvaafaru was officially inaugurated as an inhabited island by former President Mohamed Nasheed on 2 March 2009. Representatives of the American, Australian, British, Canadian, French, Japanese and New Zealand Red Cross societies and those of IFRC and the Maldivian government participated in the inaugural function. The allocation of houses was overseen by the Kandholhudhoo Island Office under the supervision of now defunct Atoll‚Äôs Ministry. Preference was given to provide shelter for people who lived at Kandholhudhoo. Hence some people belonging to Kandholhudhoo who had houses in the island were not awarded houses in Dhuvaafaru, simply because they were living elsewhere. There were complaints and disagreements as to the way the houses were distributed. IFRC held a lottery where the head of each household participated and picked the house that they will be residing in Dhuvaafaru. People started migrating to the island on 14 December 2008 and it took two weeks for the whole process to be completed. MNDF and Maldives Police Service assisted the evacuation efforts. Geography Dhuvaafaru is situated in Raa Atoll which is officially known as North Maalhosmadulu Atoll. The island is located between the atoll capital of Ungoofaaru and Maakurathu. The island is north of the country's capital, Mal√©. From Dhuvaafaru in a normal boat it takes about 20 minutes to reach atoll capital Ungoofaaru and over 8 hours to reach capital city Mal√©. Dhuvaafaru is the second largest island in Raa Atoll with of land, having a lagoon almost twice the size of the landmass. The island which is less than a meter above sea level was entirely covered with trees until they were cut down for redevelopment. A house reef protects the island which has white sandy beaches around it. Towards the west and south side of the island soil erosion has caused loss of land and plants. Houses and the power plant situated in this area are at risk due to soil erosion and storm surges. The islanders with the help of Maldives National Defence Force have constructed to some extent, concrete barriers around the shore to prevent further erosion. In the north side of Dhuvaafaru, sharing the same lagoon there is a small island which the locals call Huraagandu but its actual name is Dhuvaafaruhuraa. This small island of less than 300 feet is a landmass consisting of coral and stone and there is a wild growth of a tree called Kuredhi (ironwood). It is impossible to access inside the island due to the ironwood trees. In Dhivehi language Huraagandu is a term for small landmasses in a lagoon with corals and stones but without any form of flora. Climate The climate of the island is similar to other islands of Maldives. There are two seasons; north monsoon and south monsoon. In north monsoon it is rough seas with heavy rains. South monsoon has low winds, seas are calm and rain is less frequent. Demography Governance Previously in Maldives the islands were administered by a Katheeb (Island Chief) who is appointed by the government; in most cases for life. Under the leadership of the Island chief, the island office is run by a team of administrators who oversees matters relating to the island. The administrative hierarchy that continued for the best part of a decade in Kandholhudhoo was automatically transferred to Dhuvaafaru. There were discontent and grievances against the leadership, which was worsened due to the way the populace was managed as tsunami victims. Disagreements also flared up with the way houses were allocated in Dhuvaafaru. The newly elected government of President Mohamed Nasheed decided to make a committee called Dhuvaafaru Development Committee and appoint Dr. Ahmed Raazee; a medical doctor by profession as his envoy to the committee.http://www.miadhu.com/2008/12/local-news/dr-razee-to-guide- dhuvaafaru-development-8698/ The decision to appoint him might have been taken in light of the islander‚Äôs discontent with their original leadership but Dr. Ahmed Raazee also did not continue in this role for much longer due to various issues. The Maldivian Democratic Party led government which came to power on 11 November 2008 embarked on a mission to introduce gradual changes in the way the government was run, with the view of consolidating their power. One step taken in this regard was appointment of island and atoll Councillors who were granted powers over the existing atoll and island chiefs. This appointment was not done under a law as the Decentralization Act was not in place then. Unlike in other islands, in Dhuvaafaru a Councillor was not appointed by the president but rather an election was held to elect one. In an election held on early 2009 which was contested by three candidates, Mr. Ismail Ahmed emerged as the winner, becoming the first ever elected Councillor in the history of Maldives. He remained as the island Councillor until new Councillors were elected. Dhuvaafaru Council Office. Under the newly ratified Decentralization Act, local council elections were held across Maldives on 5 February 2011. In Dhuvaafaru numerous candidates contested as party representatives or as independents. From the seven seats available in Dhuvafaru council four seats went to Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party, two seats to independent candidates and one seat to Maldivian Democratic Party. An independent candidate, Mr. Ibrahim Shukry was elected by the Councillors as the council president. The council is assisted by civil servants in the administration of Dhuvaafaru. Dhuvaafaru is a constituency in the Parliament of the Maldives having a member who represents the island. Under Maldivian parliamentary law, islands with a population of 5000 is considered a constituency. Normally a number of islands are combined to reach this figure and form a constituency. Mr. Mohamed Zubair who ran as an independent candidate in 2009 parliamentary elections, was the first elected member of parliament from the Dhuvaafaru Constituency. In 2014 Mr. Mohamed Ali was elected as the new Member of Parliament for Dhuvaafaru on a Progressive Party of Maldives ticket. Economy Infrastructure The Dhuvaafaru project by IFRC was \\"the biggest single construction project in the organization‚Äôs history.\\" 600 houses were built for the 4000 strong population of Kandholhudhoo by August 2008 under the project. Each house had three rooms, two bathrooms, one kitchen and it was equipped with a 2500-liter tank to store rain water. Recently the government has committed to construct another 76 houses for residents who were not awarded houses in the first phase. Dhuvaafaru Harbour, funded by US and Maldives government jointly. In addition to the houses IFRC funded the construction of community infrastructure such as an administrative building, a pre-school, primary school and secondary school, an auditorium, water supply and sewage systems, a sports complex, roads, mosque, and a power supply system. Currently, there are two mosques in the island, one funded by the government. On 9 May 2010 MNDF completed the renovation of the roads in Dhuvaafaru. This project was carried out to upgrade the road condition and over of road was improved. A modern harbour costing over US Dollar 5.2 million was also constructed in the island. This project was funded jointly by the governments of United States and Maldives. Some houses in Dhuvaafaru cannot obtain clean water from the ground as the area is a marshland and there were protests in 2011 about this issue. On 18 March 2012 a project worth 13 Million Maldivian Ruffiya was awarded to Male' Water and Sewerage Company by the government to construct a water plant to produce clean mineral water for the populace. This project is conducted with the view of providing clean water to nearby islands and atolls. In the land use plan of Dhuvaafaru, land was identified for specific purposes; being one of the best planned island in the Maldives. Green zones were identified, where trees had to be planted and cutting them were prohibited. Specific areas were identified for shops and a separate industrial area was identified for works related to fisheries and agriculture. Employment Kandholhudhoo residents were avid fishermen who were popular throughout the country. In Dhuvaafaru also this trend continued and majority of the workforce are engaged in fisheries. There are various types of fishery activities that Dhuvaafaru fishermen engage in. Still the most popular form of fishing is the traditional pole and line fishing which is mainly targeted to catch tuna and skip-jack tuna. There are also divers who use diving gears to gather sea cucumbers. Catching reef fish like groupers is a constant source of income for many. Kandholhudhoo is still used by Dhuvaafaru fisherman as a hub where they conduct fishing operations. Dry fish and salted fish are harvested in Kandholhudhoo. The second popular choice of employment among Dhuvaafaru residents is in tourism field. There is only one resort in Raa Atoll. Hence Dhuvaafaru residents have to travel to distant atolls to find work at resorts. Most people who work at resorts have to stay away from their families for months. In the island there are people working in many government jobs in places like schools, health center, police station and council office. Others engage in different types of trade and craft to earn a living, while a high proportion of Dhuvaafaru population resides in Male‚Äô for employment and education opportunities. Education There are two government schools in Dhuvaafaru built by IFRC. Raa Atoll School provides secondary education to grades between 7 and 10. This school is targeted for GCE Ordinary Level students. Recently GCE Advanced Level also has been introduced. Dhuvaafaru Primary School (DPS) Dhuvaafaru Primary School carters to the grades of 1 to 6, where they teach to primary standards. A pre- school which is run privately with the assistance of government provides kindergarten education. The quality of education is affected due to none availability of trained and qualified teachers at the schools and the general attitude of the population towards education. Transport As Dhuvaafaru is an island surrounded by sea in every side, transport is mainly based on sea. There are speed boats and normal boats that people use for transport between islands. Larger vessels are used to travel to and from the Capital Male' and for faster transport residents use seaplane service from the only resort located in the atoll. Fishermen use specifically designed vessels to catch fish from the open sea. The Maldivian Democratic Party led government introduced a ferry system, whereby boats were available to travel between the islands on a cheaper fare. However, this ferry system is not running properly due to various factors. Inland, people normally use bicycles and motorbikes to drive from one place to another. Some locals provide taxi service by car and pickups are also available to transport heavy effects.

As the main character of a post named ‚ÄúI thank this obnoxious friend for bringing me such a dismal National Day‚Äù composed by Chinese netizen Rong Rong on Tianya, \\"Little Moon Moon went from the Internet into reality, becoming famous all over.\\" She is described as fat, crazy and obnoxious by the author. Since Little Moon Moon acted as the most unbelievable, shocking, annoying and obnoxious woman ever known to this day, and the posts were written during the seven-day National Day vacation in China, she became an overnight sensation. Nevertheless, after investigation, Little Moon Moon turned out to be a completely fake figure composed by a beautiful writer Xu Jiayi to maintain the shrinking influence of Tianya forum.  Event overview At 11:45 in the morning on October 5, 2010, a netizen started to posts diaries on Tianya forum with the ID \\"Rong Rong\\". The series of live updates recorded an astonishing story of Little Moon Moon (Rong Rong's high school classmate) and her boyfriend's visit to Shanghai Expo during the National Day holiday, with Rong Rong being their host showing them around, and along the journey, endless miserable and crazy things happened (such as Little Moon Moon's self-suicide farce, singing weird poetry, etc.). The writer used tons of words to describe how she was completely \\"astounded/superfied\\" by Little Moon Moon during the two days and one night. Rong Rong stopped posting on October 13 with sentences like ‚ÄúI went out to deal with some things.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if this post will reach an ending on this day.‚Äù The humorous and absurd story quickly drew numerous attention. Within two days, the post has over 17 million views and over 57 thousand comments over 564 pages. As for Weibo (also called microbloggings, the Chinese version of Twitter), the topic of Little Moon Moon was already ranked number 3, with 17293 tweets in that day, more than any other hot topic of the week. At first, netizens thought the incident and the people described in the posts were real, however, over the evolution of this matter, more and more readers felt that there must be a publicity team behind the scenes to stir such a huge wave on the Internet. Netizens even created pages for Little Moon Moon at the Baidu Encyclopedia and the Baidu Post Bar as well as study group and human flesh search/cyber hunting group. There was also a fan posted a comic version of this case, which is called ‚ÄúStupefying Girl Xiao Yue Yue Visits The World Expo Incident Complete Version‚Äù.  Reflection and introspection In apparent contrast with the horrible Little Moon Moon's profile, which was portrayed as an ugly kindergarten teacher who is 150 cm tall and 80 kilograms in weight, the real writer behind the whole event is a beautiful sophomore student at Shanghai Normal University. Although she claimed that every word she wrote was real, the truth that it was a pure publicity stunt was revealed. \\"Insiders disclosed that Tianya is currently preparing to go public on the stock market, and is under pressure for its declining influence, and thus urgently needed a major incident to raise its influence, which is how ‚ÄúLittle Moon Moon‚Äù happened. Since this was a topic the forum Tianya itself launched, one where there is no obvious commercial goal, where the language matched the tastes of the netizen masses, successfully attracting netizen eyeballs, having achieved a large effect with little effort.\\" The live broadcast posts were designed to be the warming-up phase of the publicity stunt, with the climax point uncovering a real life version of ‚ÄúLittle Moon Moon‚Äù, who is a brilliant writing beauty. By using this huge contrast, Tianya planned to arouse a bigger controversy, thus allowing netizens to participate and making the Little Moon Moon to become a continuing internet topic. As most of the Chinese netizens participated in this \\"cyber carnival\\" as excited as they did before, some of them even created the \\"Religion of Moon‚Äù so she can be ‚Äúworshiped‚Äù (in a sarcastic way). However, others possess a more sober perspective. Is this just a well- organized publicity stunt? Is it the same game as ‚ÄúJia Junpeng, your mom is waiting for you to go home for dinner‚Äù played, purely man-made phenomenon? Is it another victory of the Internet Water Army to promote the product? Do the wire-puller and the internet army have the power to hoodwink the public and manipulate whatever attentions they like? Another concern rising with this case is the unhealthy web culture. As a web commentator called Run my deer said, \\"we can all agree the fact that we are, or rather, we have entered an era of appreciating ugliness. From Sister Furong to Sister Feng, our visual and moral senses are being continuously challenged by these breaking news...Moreover, the age group of Chinese netizens are decreasing, this vulgarifcation of web culture is not only going to be adult‚Äôs entertainment, but will very likely have negative impacts on our youths.\\" References Category:Chinese Internet celebrities Category:Publicity stunts Category:2010s hoaxes ","title":"Little Moon Moon"},{"id":"37987911","text":"Fertility is an unincorporated community located along Strasburg Pike, in East Lampeter Township in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States.

The Sawbwa wants him caught and executed, while Captain Cardigan wants him caught for trial. Brecan flees through the jungle with a bag of rubies from the mine and reaches the estate of Gwen Moore, who uses elephants to harvest teak. Brecan arrives there calling himself \\"Jim Martin\\". He and Gwen are attracted to each other. After he helps her deal with some problems, including a killer tiger, she makes him her manager. Cardigan arrives at the estate and Brecan flees when he realizes who Cardigan is. Gwen follows them, preventing Brecan from killing Cardigan, which allows Cardigan to capture Brecan. He starts to take them back to Rangoon. However, when they stop for the night, they are attacked by Kaw bandits, which allows Brecan to escape. Weather soon forces all three to spend another night together in an abandoned Buddhist temple. Brecan and Gwen make it back to her estate, where the local police attack. After Gwen is wounded, Brecan surrenders. He is taken to Rangoon for punishment. A boy who was the dead prince's servant shows up with a letter from the prince to the Sawbwa. The Sawbwa condemns Brecan to death; he is taken out for a pre-execution flogging. Gwen and Cardigan arrive and she convinces the Sawbwa to read the letter. The prince had the plague and, in his delirium, was about to expose a village to the disease, forcing Brecan to shoot him. The Sawbwa releases him. Brecan gives all the rubies to the Sawbwa, and it appears Brecan and Gwen will live happily ever after.

He was present at the Battle of Culloden on 16 April 1746, when he had command of the left wing of the royal army. In the middle of August following he arrived at Aberdeen and assumed the command of the troops stationed in that quarter, but died there on 25 November 1746. His remains were interred in the Drum Aisle in the West Church of that city on 1 December following. Lord Sempill had been married on 13 May 1718 to Sarah, daughter of Nathaniel Gaskell of Manchester. They had five sons, including John Sempill, 13th Lord Sempill, and six daughters, the eldest of whom, Sarah, married Patrick Crauford MP. Lady Sempill died on 17 April 1749. A portrait of Hugh, 12th Lord Sempill can be seen in a new Sempill history.Roxine A.

It roughly corresponds to the early modern era in Europe, beginning with the Renaissance and Reformation and ending with the last Jacobite risings and the beginnings of the industrial revolution. Monarchs of this period were the Stuarts: James IV, James V, Mary Queen of Scots, James VI, Charles I, Charles II, James VII, William III and Mary II, Anne, and the Hanoverians: George I and George II. The crown remained the most important element of government throughout the period and, despite the many royal minorities, it saw many of the aspects of aggrandisement associated with \\"new monarchy\\" elsewhere in Europe. Theories of limited monarchy and resistance were articulated by Scots, particularly George Buchanan, in the sixteenth century, but James VI advanced the theory of the divine right of kings, and these debates were restated in subsequent reigns and crises. The court remained at the centre of political life, and in the sixteenth century emerged as a major centre of display and artistic patronage. The Privy Council and the great offices of state, remained central to the administration of the government, even after the departure of the Stuart monarchs to rule in England from 1603, but they were often sidelined and was abolished after the Act of Union of 1707, with rule direct from London. Parliament was also vital to the running of the country, providing laws and taxation, but it had fluctuating fortunes and never achieved the centrality the national life of its counterpart in England before it was disbanded in 1707. Revenue remained a continual problem for Scottish government, even after the introduction of regular taxation from the 1580s, with receipts insufficient for the business of government and, after 1603, much of the costs being paid out of English revenues. In local government, attempts were made increase its effectiveness, with the creation of Justices of Peace and Commissioners of Supply. The continued existence of courts baron and introduction of kirk sessions helped consolidate the power of local lairds. In law there was an expansion of central institutions and professionalisation of lawyers as a group. Scottish law was maintained as a separate system after the union in 1707 and from 1747 the central courts gained a clear authority over local institutions. Crown George Buchanan (1506‚Äì82), one of the major thinkers of the era on resistance to monarchy James V was the first Scottish monarch to wear the closed imperial crown, in place of the open circlet of medieval kings, suggesting a claim to absolute authority within the kingdom. His diadem was reworked to include arches in 1532, which were re-added when it was reconstructed in 1540 in what remains the Crown of Scotland. The idea of imperial monarchy emphasised the dignity of the crown and included its role as a unifying national force, defending national borders and interests, royal supremacy over the law and a distinctive national church within the Catholic communion.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 188. New monarchy can also be seen in the reliance of the crown on \\"new men\\" rather than the great magnates, the use of the clergy as a form of civil service, developing standing armed forces and a navy.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), . Major intellectual figures in the Reformation included George Buchanan (1506‚Äì82), whose works De Jure Regni apud Scotos (1579) and Rerum Scoticarum Historia (1582) were among the major texts outlining the case for resistance to tyrants. Buchanan was one of the young James VI's tutors and although they succeeded in producing a highly educated Protestant prince, who would publish works on subjects including government, poetry and witchcraft, they failed to intellectually convince him of their ideas about limited monarchy and he would debate with Buchanan and others over the status of the crown and kirk.Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", pp. 200‚Äì2. James asserted the concept of \\"Divine right\\", by which a king was appointed by God and thus gained a degree of sanctity. These ideas he passed on to Charles I, whose ability to compromise may have been undermined by them, helping to lead to his political difficulties.C. Carlton. Charles I: The Personal Monarch (London: Routledge, 1995), , p. 20. When he was executed in 1649, the Scottish Covenanters objected, but avoided advancing the sanctity of kings as a reason.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 60. In 1689, when the Scottish Estates had to find a justification for deposing James VII they turned to Buchanan's argument on the contractual nature of monarchy in the Claim of Right.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Pimlico, 1992), , p. 302. Court The Stirling Heads, carved roundels on the roof of the King's Chamber in Stirling Castle, include many members of the court of James V The royal court consisted of leading nobles, office holders, ambassadors and supplicants who surrounded the king or queen. At its centre was the monarch and members of the Privy Chamber. Gentleman of the chamber were usually leading nobles or individuals with kinship links to the leading noble families. They had direct access to the monarch, with the implication of being to exert influence, and were usually resident at the court.J. Goodacre, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), , pp. 88‚Äì9. Although increasingly based at the royal palace of Holyrood in Edinburgh, the monarch and the court were often itinerant, spending time at one of the royal palaces, such as Linlithgow, Stirling and Falkland, or undertaking a royal progress or \\"justice ayre\\" to a part of the kingdom to ensure that the rule of law, royal authority or smooth government was maintained. In the sixteenth century, the court was central to the patronage and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas. It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy. This display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry, which was evolving in this period from a practical military ethos into a more ornamental and honorific cult. Tournaments provided one focus of display and were also pursued enthusiastically by James V, proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood. During her brief personal rule Mary, Queen of Scots brought many of the elaborate court activities that she had grown up with at the French court, with balls, masques and celebrations, designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity.Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", pp. 192‚Äì3. Under James VI the court returned to being a centre of culture and learning and he cultivated the image of a philosopher king, evoking the models of David, Solomon and Constantine. Court spectacles included the coronation of Anne of Denmark and the baptism of Prince Henry.Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", p. 200. After James VI inherited the English throne in 1603 the Scottish court effectively ceased to exist, ending its role as a centre of artistic patronage, political display and intrigue.R. Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603‚Äì1745 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), , p. 12. Officers of state Great Seal of Mary Queen of Scots (1542‚Äì67) The Chancellor was effectively the first minister of the kingdom. His department, the chancery, was responsible for the Great Seal, which was needed to process the inheritance of land titles and the confirmation of land transfers. His key responsibility was to preside at meetings of the privy council, and on those rare occasions he attended, at meetings of the court of session.Goodacre, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625, pp. 150‚Äì1. The second most prestigious office was the Secretary, who was responsible for the records of the Privy council and for foreign policy, including the borders, despite which the post retained its importance after the Union of Crowns in 1603.Goodacre, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625, p. 151. The Treasurer was the last of the major posts and, with the Comptroller, dealt with the royal finances until the Comptroller's office was merged into the Treasurer's from 1610.Goodacre, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625, p. 152. The Lord President of the Court of Session, often known simply as the Lord President, acted as a link between the Privy Council and the Court.Goodacre, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625, p. 160. The king's advocate acted as the legal council. The post emerged in the 1490s to deal with the king's patrimonial land rights and from 1555 there were usually two king's councillors, indicating the increase in the level of work. From 1579 they increasingly became a public prosecutor.Goodacre, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625, p. 164. After the union most of the offices remained, but political power was increasingly centred in London. John Ker, 1st Duke of Roxburghe, became the first Secretary of State for Scotland until the post was abolished in 1746 after the Jacobite Rising of 1745.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 282‚Äì4. Privy council Detail from the so-called 'Hertford sketch' of Edinburgh in 1544, showing Holyrood Palace, described as 'the kyng of Skotts palas' The Privy Council developed out of the theoretically larger king's or queen's council of leading nobles and office holders in the sixteenth century. \\"Secret Councils\\" had been maintained during the many regencies of the later medieval era, but the origins of the Privy Council were in 1543, during the minority of Mary, Queen of Scots. After her majority it was not disbanded, but continued to sit and became an accepted part of government.Goodacre, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625, pp. 35 and 130. Until 1707, while in session in Edinburgh, the Privy Council met in what is now the West Drawing Room at the Palace of Holyroodhouse.Miles Glendinning, Aonghus MacKechnie, Richard D. Oram, The Architecture of Scottish Government: from Kingship to Parliamentary Democracy (Dundee: Dundee University Press, 2004), , p. 144. When the monarch was at one of the royal palaces or visiting a region of the kingdom on official business, the council would normally go with them and as a result of being away from its servants, records and members, its output tended to decrease. While the monarch was away on a holiday or hunting trip, the council usually stayed in session in Edinburgh and continued to run the government.Goodacre, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625, p. 141. The Privy Council's primary function was judicial, but it also acted as a body of advisers to the king and as a result its secondary function was as an executive in the absence or minority of the monarchy. Although the monarch might often attend the council, their presence was not necessary for the council to act with royal authority.Goodacre, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625, p. 140. Like parliament, it had the power to issue acts that could have the force of law.Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603‚Äì1745, p. 15. After James VI's departure to England in 1603, it functioned as a subservient executive carrying out his instructions from London. Although the theoretical membership of the council was relatively large, at around 30 persons, most of the business was carried out by an informal inner group, consisting mainly of the officers of state.Goodacre, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625, p. 135. Before 1610 the council was presided over by the Lord Chancellor, but in 1610 James VI decreed that the President of the College of Justice should preside in the Chancellor's absence, and by 1619 the additional title of President of the Privy Council had been added. The two presidencies were separated in 1626 as part of Charles I's reorganisation of the Privy Council and Court of Session. The Lord President of the Council was accorded precedence as one of the King's chief officers in 1661. After the Restoration, Charles II nominated his own privy councillors and set up a council in London through which he directed affairs in Edinburgh, a situation that continued after the Glorious Revolution of 1688‚Äì9. The council was abolished after the Act of Union on 1 May 1708.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, p. 287. Parliament Parliament House, built by Charles I to house the Parliament of Scotland, pictured c. 1647 In the sixteenth century, parliament usually met in Stirling Castle or the Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh, which was rebuilt on the orders of Mary Queen of Scots from 1561. King Charles I ordered the construction of Parliament Hall, at the expense of the Edinburgh burgesses, which was built between 1633 and 1639 and remained the parliament's home until it was dissolved in 1707.R. A. Mason, Scots and Britons: Scottish Political Thought and the Union of 1603 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), , p. 82. By the end of the Middle Ages the Parliament had evolved from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls into a 'colloquium' with a political and judicial role.K. M. Brown and R. J. Tanner, The History of the Scottish Parliament volume 1: Parliament and Politics, 1235‚Äì1560 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , pp. 1‚Äì28. The attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and burgh commissioners joined them to form the Three Estates.Alan R. MacDonald, The Burghs and Parliament in Scotland, c. 1550‚Äì1651 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), , p. 14.K. M. Brown, Parliament and Politics in Scotland, 1235‚Äì1560 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 50. It acquired significant powers over particular issues, including consent for taxation, but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and other legislation, whether political, ecclesiastical, social or economic. Much of the legislative business of the Scottish parliament was carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the Lords of the Articles, chosen by the three estates to draft legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed.R. J. Tanner, 'The Lords of the Articles before 1540', Scottish Historical Review, 79 (2000), pp. 189‚Äì212. Like many continental assemblies the Scottish Parliament was being called less frequently by the early sixteenth century and might have been dispensed with by the crown had it not been for the series of minorities and regencies that dominated from 1513.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , p. 21. The crown was also able to call a Convention of Estates, which was quicker to assemble and could issue laws like parliament, making them invaluable in a crisis, but they could only deal with a specific issue and were more resistant to the giving of taxation rights to the crown. Parliament played a major part in the Reformation crisis of the mid-sixteenth century. It had been used by James V to uphold Catholic orthodoxyWormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, p. 22. and asserted its right to determine the nature of religion in the country, disregarding royal authority in 1560. The 1560 parliament included 100 lairds, who were predominantly Protestant, and who claimed a right to sit in the Parliament under the provision of a failed shire election act of 1428. Their position in the parliament remained uncertain and their presence fluctuated until the 1428 act was revived in 1587 and provision made for the annual election of two commissioners from each shire (except Kinross and Clackmannan, which had one each). The property qualification for voters was for freeholders who held land from the crown of the value of 40s of auld extent. This excluded the growing class of feuars, who would not gain these rights until 1661.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, p. 157. The clerical estate was marginalised in Parliament by the Reformation, with the laymen who had acquired the monasteries sitting as 'abbots' and 'priors'. Catholic clergy were excluded after 1567, but a small number of Protestant bishops continued as the clerical estate. James VI attempted to revive the role of the bishops from about 1600.Goodacre, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625, p. 46. They were abolished by the Covenanters in 1638, when Parliament became an entirely lay assembly.A. I. Macinnes, Union and Empire: The Making of the United Kingdom in 1707, Cambridge Studies in Early Modern British History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), , p. 68. A further group appeared in the Parliament from the minority of James IV in the 1560s, with members of the Privy Council representing the king's interests, until they were excluded in 1641.F. N. McCoy, Robert Baillie and the Second Scots Reformation (Berkeley CA: University of California Press, 1974), , pp. 1‚Äì2. James VI continued to manage parliament though the Lords of the Articles, who deliberated legislation before it reached the full parliament. He controlled the committee by filling it with royal officers as non-elected members, but was forced to limit this to eight from 1617.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, p. 158. The Riding of Parliament c. 1685, from Nicholas de Gueudeville's, Atlas Historique, ou Nouvelle Introduction √† l'Histoire √† la Chronologie & √† la G√©ographie Ancienne & Moderne (Amsterdam, 1720) Having been officially suspended at the end of the Cromwellian regime, parliament returned after the Restoration of Charles II in 1661. This parliament, known disparagingly as the 'Drunken Parliament', revoked most of the Presbyterian gains of the last thirty years.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 231‚Äì4. Subsequently Charles' absence from Scotland and use of commissioners to rule his northern kingdom undermined the authority of the body. James VII's parliament supported him against rivals and attempted rebellions, but after his escape to exile in 1689 William's first parliament was dominated by his supporters and, in contrast to the situation in England, effectively deposed James under the Claim of Right, which offered the crown to William and Mary, placing important limitations on royal power, including the abolition of the Lords of the Articles.Mitchison, A History of Scotland, p. 253. Rosalind Mitchison argues that the parliament became a focus of national political life, but it never reached the position of a true centre of national identity attained by its English counterpart.Mitchison, A History of Scotland, p. 128. The new Williamite parliament would subsequently bring about its own demise by the Act of Union in 1707.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, p. 238. The English and Scottish parliaments were replaced by a combined Parliament of Great Britain, but it sat in Westminster and largely continued English traditions without interruption. Forty-five Scots were added to the 513 members of the House of Commons and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the House of Lords.Mitchison, A History of Scotland, p. 314. Taxation and revenue For the early part of the era, the authority of the crown was limited by the large number of minorities it had seen since the early fifteenth century, with every monarch coming to the throne as a minor between 1406 and 1625. This tended to decrease the level of royal revenues, as regents, lacking the royal authority to create support, often alienated land and revenues, with Margaret Tudor reducing royal income from about ¬£30,000 Scots to ¬£13,000 in the minority of James V.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, p. 13. James V was able to extract the heaviest taxation every levied on the Scottish church in exchange for his continued loyalty to the papacy, taking ¬£72,000 in four years.R. Mason, \\"Renaissance and Reformation: the sixteenth century\\", in J. Wormald, ed., Scotland: A History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 102. Regular taxation was adopted from 1581 and afterwards was called on with increasing frequency and scale until a demand of ¬£240,000 in 1612 resulted in serious opposition. A new tax on annual rents amounting to five per cent on all interest on loans, mainly directed at the merchants of the burghs was introduced in 1621, but the 1621 levy was still being collected over a decade later.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, p. 161. Under Charles I the annual income from all sources in Scotland was under ¬£16,000 sterling and inadequate for the normal costs of government, with the court in London now being financed out of English revenues.Mitchison, A History of Scotland, pp. 29‚Äì30. The sum of ¬£10,000 a month from the county assessment was demanded by the Cromwellian regime, which Scotland failed to fully supply, but it did contribute ¬£35,000 in excise a year. Although Parliament made a formal grant of ¬£40,000 a year to Charles II, the rising costs of civilian government and war meant that this was inadequate to support Scottish government.Mitchison, A History of Scotland, p. 70. Under William I and after the Union, engagement in continental and colonial wars led to heavier existing taxes and new taxes, including the Poll and Hearth Taxes.Mitchison, A History of Scotland, pp. 123 and 136-7. Local government The jougs at Duddingston Parish Church, ordered to be established for beggars and other offenders from 1593 From the sixteenth century, the central government became increasingly involved in local affairs. The feud was limited and regulated, local taxation became much more intrusive and from 1607 regular, local commissions of Justices of the Peace on the English model were established to deal with petty crimes and infractions.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, pp. 162‚Äì3. Greater control was exerted over the lawless Borders through a joint commission with the English, set up in 1587. James VI was much more hostile to the culture and particularism of the Highlands than his predecessors. He sent colonists from Fife to parts of the region and forced the Highland chiefs to accept Lowland language and culture through the Statues of Iona of 1609.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, pp. 164‚Äì5. From the seventeenth century the responsibilities of shires expanded from judicial functions into wider local administration. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were appointed in each sheriffdom or shire to collect the cess land tax.R. A. Houston, I. D. Whyte, Scottish Society, 1500‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 202. The parish also became an important unit of local government after three major pieces of legislation, in 1574, 1579 and 1592, established what would become known as \\"the Old Poor Law\\".Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, , pp. 166‚Äì8. Pressured by Justices, the parish became responsible for taking care of the destitute in periods of famine, to prevent the impoverished from taking to the roads and causing general disorder.Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603‚Äì1745, p. 144. By the mid-seventeenth century the system had largely been rolled out across the Lowlands, but was limited in the Highlands.O. P. Grell and A. Cunningham, Health Care and Poor Relief in Protestant Europe, 1500‚Äì1700 (London: Routledge, 1997), , p. 37. It was able to cope with the general level of poverty and minor crises, helping the old and infirm to survive and provide life support in periods of downturn at relatively low cost, but was overwhelmed in major subsistence crisis like that of the \\"seven ill years\\" of the 1690s.Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603‚Äì1745, pp. 127 and 145. Behaviour could be regulated through kirk sessions, composed of local church elders, which replaced the church courts of the Middle Ages, and which dealt with moral and religious conduct. The local court baron remained important in regulating minor interpersonal and property offences. They were held at the behest of the local baron when there was a backlog of cases and could appoint birleymen, usually senior tenants, who would resolve disputes and issues. The combination of kirk sessions and courts baron gave considerable power to local lairds to control the behaviour of the populations of their communities.Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603‚Äì1745, pp. 80‚Äì1. Law Institution of the Court of Session by James V in 1532, from the Great Window in Parliament Hall, Edinburgh In the late Middle Ages, justice in Scotland was a mixture of the royal and local, which was often unsystematic with overlapping jurisdictions, undertaken by clerical lawyers, laymen, amateurs and local leaders.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, pp. 24‚Äì5. Under James IV the legal functions of the council were rationalised, with a royal Court of Session meeting daily in Edinburgh to deal with civil cases. In 1514 the office of justice-general was created for the earl of Argyll (and held by his family until 1628). The study of law was popular in Scotland from the Middle Ages and many students travelled to Continental Europe to study canon law and civil law.K. Reid and R. Zimmerman, A History of Private Law in Scotland: I. Introduction and Property (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), , p. 68. In 1532 the Royal College of Justice was founded, leading to the training and professionalisation of an emerging group of career lawyers. The Court of Session placed increasing emphasis on its independence from influence, including from the king, and superior jurisdiction over local justice. Its judges were increasingly able to control entry to their own ranks. In 1605 the professionalisation of the bench led to entry requirements in Latin, law and a property qualification of ¬£2,000, designed to limit the danger of bribery, helping to create an exclusive, wealthy, powerful and professional caste, who also now dominated government posts in a way that the clergy had done in the Middle Ages.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, pp. 154‚Äì5. In 1672 the High Court of Justiciary was founded from the College of Justice as a supreme court of appeal. The Act of Union in 1707 largely persevered the distinct Scottish legal system and its courts, separate from English jurisdiction.Anne-Marie Kilday, Women and Violent Crime in Enlightenment Scotland (Boydell & Brewer, 2007), , p. 29. The major reform to Scottish law came as a result of the Heritable Jurisdictions Act 1747, which was part of the government reaction to the Jacobite rising of 1745 and which limited the powers of burgh courts, abolished hereditary offices and made the barony and regality courts obsolete, strengthening the reach of the central judicial courts.Kilday, Women and Violent Crime in Enlightenment Scotland, p. 31. This period also saw widespread attempts to codify and comment on the Scottish legal system. The first substantive account of Scottish law was the Practicks of Bishop John Sinclair (d. 1566), senator of the College of Justice. This was followed by James Balfour's (c. 1525‚Äì83) Practicks, who with Sir John Skene of Curriehill (c. 1543‚Äì1617), was a major figure in the move to codification. Skene produced an edition of the Acts of Parliament and a legal dictionary, De Verborum Significatione and edited Regiam Maisestatem, a history of the Scottish law, which attributed much of its creation to David I. Thomas Craig of Riccarton (c. 1538‚Äì1608) produced two large works, Jus Feudale, which examined feudal law, and De Unione Regnorum Britanniae, which explored the possibilities of unifying the English and Scottish legal systems. Often seen as the beginning of modern Scottish legal study is James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair's (1619‚Äì95) The Institutions of the Law of Scotland (1681).Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, p. 178.

Moyle's likeness was used for the adult male in the creation of this stature. John Rowe Moyle (22 February 1808, Wendron, Cornwall, England ‚Äì 15 January 1889, Alpine, Utah Territory) was a Mormon pioneer and a settler of Alpine, Utah. He was a master stonemason for the Salt Lake Temple, and was the carver of the inscription \\"Holiness to the Lord\\" on the temple's east side. Biography Moyle was born in Cornwall, England, to James and Elizabeth Rowe Moyle.Some sources give the name of John Rowe Moyle's father as Stephen. See: ; In his youth he worked in the tin mines of Cornwall, and later became a stonemason, learning the trade from his father. He and his family converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1851. Moyle travelled to Utah Territory with the first handcart company in 1856, settling in Alpine two years later. Both a farmer and a stonemason, Moyle traveled to Salt Lake City frequently to serve on the temple construction. Moyle installed the Temple's circular staircase and carved the inscription \\"Holiness to the Lord\\" on the east side of the Temple. In 1863, Moyle built a chapel in Alpine. He also built an Indian fort to protect his family during the invasion of Salt Lake City by federal troops. Moyle suffered a compound fracture of the leg when he was kicked by a cow, necessitating the leg's amputation by his family and friends. Moyle subsequently carved a wooden leg for himself and learned how to use it. After the accident, he would again walk to Salt Lake City and work on the temple. Moyle was married to Phillippa Beer, who was born in Devonshire, England, and (polygamously) to Mary Ann Williams. Moyle's son, James Moyle, became foreman of the builders and stone-cutters on the Temple Block in 1875 and general superintendent of the temple in 1886. Moyle was the grandfather of James Henry Moyle, a prominent Utah politician, and the great- grandfather of Henry D. Moyle, an apostle of the LDS Church.Uchtdorf erroneously refers to Henry D. Moyle as John Rowe Moyle's \\"grandson\\". Legacy Torleif S. Knaphus used Moyle's likeness (along with several others) as the inspiration for the father's face on the Handcart Pioneer Monument on Temple Square.

It consisted of several connected buildings, centered on an original brick sanctuary building that was built from 1846 to 1852. The original sanctuary was slated for demolition by May 2020 following tornado damage. The grounds also include 1928‚Äì29 educational building, a 1959‚Äì60 second educational and office addition, a modern sanctuary built in 1967, and educational wing and fellowship hall that was completed in 1991. All of the buildings are centered on the original sanctuary and are linked together by a series of passages and corridors at the rear of the property. The original sanctuary was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage in 1977 and the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. History The church congregation traces its origins back to the Coosa River Baptist Church that was established in the area in May 1821. The congregation relocated to Wetumpka in 1837 and combined with another existing congregation, renamed as the Coosa River Church of Wetumpka. It assumed its current name of First Baptist Church Of Wetumpka in 1842. Following major fires in the town during 1844 and again in 1845, the congregation began building a new brick building west of the river on property donated to them by Seth Paddock Storrs. Storrs was a member of the Presbyterian denomination, but was married to a devout Baptist woman from Massachusetts. Construction of the historic brick sanctuary began in 1846, but proceeded slowly for several years due to funding issues. Eventually the leaders of the church turned over fund- raising to the women of the congregation, who held \\"bake sales, picnics, barbecues and quilt sales\\" until the needed funding was raised to complete the building. It was finished by the spring of 1852 and dedicated on July 11, 1852. It was substantially altered in 1909 by leading Montgomery architect Frank Lockwood. The alterations included an almost complete remodelling of the interior and the replacement of the Gothic Revival pointed arch windows with new round arched stained glass replacements. Having outgrown the original building by the 1960s, the congregation had a new 687-seat capacity sanctuary constructed adjacent to the original. It was built to the designs of Montgomery architect Tom B. Kirkland. The new sanctuary was dedicated on July 11, 1967, exactly 115 years after the dedication of the original. The original sanctuary was rarely used after this point and had substantially deteriorated by the 1990s due to a leaking roof. The congregation, fearing the loss of the building, raised funds for a full restoration of the interior and exterior of what was now referred to as the \\"historic chapel.\\" It was completed in time for a rededication on July 11, 1998. The original sanctuary suffered extensive damage on January 19, 2019, with the entire roof and belfry being removed by an EF2 tornado. The majority of the congregation voted in 2020 to demolish the historic sanctuary. A weakened support structure and mold were noted as primary concerns. The historic stained glass windows and other artifacts were removed in late May 2020 in preparation for demolition.

Considered the innovator of the modern pit stop, Wood's team is recognized as the first to record a 25-second four tire pit stop in NASCAR history. During his tenure as crew chief, the Wood team won 96 races with 117 poles clinched. Early life Wood was born on September 22, 1934 on a family farm near Stuart, Virginia as one of six children (five sons and one daughter), and began building vehicles when he built a wagon with logs for wheels, which is intended to roll downhill. When he was 13, Wood placed a washing machine engine on a go-kart frame, and used various pulleys and chains from salvaged vehicles at his father's shop to propel the vehicle, which was able to reach a top speed of . The go-kart is currently on display in Stuart's Wood Brothers Museum. In high school, Wood learned to build an engine from watching his father, Walter, disassemble the engine from the team's car, and successfully rebuilt it. NASCAR In 1950, Wood and two of his brothers, Glen and Delano, purchased a 1940 Ford, which was later modified and used in NASCAR, and the team made its first start in a Lincoln at Martinsville Speedway on May 17, 1953. Wood was the team's engine builder, and the team's pit crew, originally composed of family and friends, became the first team in NASCAR history to record a 25-second four tire pit stop. Wood stated that in 1960 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, he noticed that Fireball Roberts', had the lead at the time, pit crew took 45 seconds to change two tires and fuel; Roberts' team was using a four-prong lug wrench, so Wood's team decided to use power wrenches, which cut down the time to 25 seconds. Wood later modernized the floor jack; originally, jacks weighed between 70 and 80 pounds, and required at least ten pumps for tire clearance. Wood disassembled the jacks and installed larger pistons, leading to only two to three pumps to clear. In 1965, Wood's team was hired by Jim Clark to pit for him in the 1965 Indianapolis 500, which went on to win. The team used a modified fuel can to make the gas flow faster. In 2006, Wood was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. On May 23, 2012, Wood was named as one of the members of the 2013 NASCAR Hall of Fame inductees, and was inducted on February 8, 2013. Wood earned 57 percent of the votes, tied with Herb Thomas. At the 2012 Brickyard 400, Wood Brothers Racing honored Wood with a special paint scheme with candy apple red instead of metal-flake red, which the team switched to in 1971, and Wood's head shot on the hood.

History The town hall was located along the Altst√§dtischer Markt, a market near the Pregel River. Its original construction date and style is unknown, but it was rebuilt in the Gothic style in 1528. It was then rebuilt in 1757 and had a tower added in 1765. It expanded with an annex along Schmiedestra√üe in 1832. The building contained works by the K√∂nigsberg-born sculptor Rudolf Siemering. After the defeat of rebels in the neighboring K√∂nigsberg town of Kneiphof in 1455 during the Thirteen Years' War, the town hall was decorated with the first Japper, a mocking mask facing in the direction of Kneiphof. A bearded head was installed during the renovation of 1528; it included a mechanism which allowed a tongue to extend toward Kneiphof each hour. This was ruined in 1774 when a sparrow flew into the clockwork; the citizens of Kneiphof subsequently referred to their neighbors in Altstadt as Sperlingschlucker, or sparrow eaters. A third Japper depicting a golden lion's head was added during the 1832 expansion and became popular with children. With the unification of the three towns into a single city in 1724 and the selection of the Kneiphof Town Hall as city hall, Altstadt's Rathaus instead hosted the Stadtgericht (city court). It also contained the K√∂nigsberg City Archive from 1724 to 1911 and the K√∂nigsberg Public Library from 1773 to 1810. Courses for the city's business school were held inside the town hall from 1907 to 1924. It also contained the city Sparkasse during the 1920s. The Altstadt Town Hall was rebuilt after an internal fire on 6 March 1940, but was subsequently destroyed in August 1944 during the Bombing of K√∂nigsberg in World War II.

The lake is a remnant of a larger Pleistocene lake that covered much of the valley, east of Steens Mountain. Fields-Denio Road runs along the east side of the lake. Inflow to Mann Lake comes from small, intermittent streams, mainly from Steens Mountain. The lake, which has no outlet, but loses water by evaporation, is hypereutrophic. An influx of cattle waste from nearby rangelands adds to the lake's natural eutrophic state. Large concentrations of Cladophora algae are common. The Bureau of Land Management operates the Mann Lake Recreation Site, about southeast of Burns by highway and unpaved road. The site has vault restrooms and boat ramps, but no other amenities. Recreation at or near the site includes fishing, camping, hiking, wildlife viewing, and amateur geology. Mann Lake, stocked with Lahontan cutthroat trout, has been called \\"one of the premiere trout fisheries in southeast Oregon\\". Trout in the lake range in length from . Fishing is restricted to artificial flies and lures. A large population of goldfish, introduced illegally, have at times multiplied in Mann Lake and competed for food with the smaller trout. In 2010, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife treated the lake with rotenone, a piscicide, killing around 200,000 goldfish and fathead minnows while sparing nearly all the trout.

It is operated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) as a tallgrass prairie nature preserve and as a fish and wildlife area managed for deer hunting. Description Revis Hill is managed as a fragile ecosystem of loess, a loose, powdered loamy soil type formed from silt ground fine by glaciation and other events. After the loess was wind-deposited on the terrain of what became southern Mason County, Illinois to form a low hill, it was subject to rapid erosion and Revis Hill was dissected by ravines that drained into nearby Salt Creek. Tallgrass prairie plants, such as little bluestem grass, purple coneflower, and leadplant countered the erosion by developing significant, interlaced root systems that held much of the loessy dust in place in the uplands. Meanwhile, in the dissected ravines, an upland oak-hickory forest grew. The transition belts between the loessy hill prairie and the ravine woodlands developed into oak savanna. Animals adapted to Revis Hill include whitetail deer, turkey vultures and bank swallows. The Illinois Nature Preserves Commission advises visitors to be on the lookout for bluebirds, western hognose snakes, and prairie walking stick insects. Most of the Illinois hill prairie ecosystems that resembled Revis Hill were lost to the moldboard plow. Revis Hill re-entered the public domain and was dedicated by the state of Illinois as a natural area in August 1973. Land management practices utilized at Revis Hill include prescribed burning and the control of invasive species. The preserve is also managed for archery and firearm deer hunting, by permit only.

The field was further popularized following the cytologic application of the electron microscope which found that many metabolic pathways take place on the cell membrane, whose properties are strongly influenced by its lipid composition. Clinical lipidology The Framingham Heart Study and other epidemiological studies have found a correlation between lipoproteins and cardiovascular disease.Therapeutic lipidology, p. vii-viii A class of lipids known as phospholipids help make up what is known as lipoproteins, and a type of lipoprotein is called high density lipoprotein (HDL).

On June 6, 1499, he obtained a license from the Catholic Monarchs to sail to the Indies, which authorized him to take four caravels, although ultimately he only chartered two. They were supposed to head north to start the exploration of the coast of North America, or perhaps to enter into the competition of the Brazilian exploration. By October 1500, they successfully passed south of Cape St. Augustine, which was the first time that a Spanish ship succeeded. He continued descending until he reached a river called Cervutos. Later it was realized his discoveries had a double consequence. * On one hand, he demonstrated that the end of St. Augustine was not an island but actually belonged to a continent and that, on having extended on the south, it was entering the Portuguese jurisdiction. * However, having sailed towards the south, and to verify that the coast was going towards the south-west, it was discovered that the grounds were again inside the Spanish demarcation (district) opening a wide horizon of opportunities for exploration. In May 1501, they finally returned to Seville, Spain with Brazilian slaves, although without finding the southern tip of the continent which they had expected to be at the same latitude as the Cape of Good Hope On February 15, 1502, Alonso V√©lez de Mendoza earned a capitulation which allowed him to settle in Hispaniola with fifty settlers and their families, in order to create a new population. There was a fleet of thirty other ships carrying 2,500 colonists that arrived in Hispaniola the same year. This included the arrival of Nicol√°s de Ovando y C√°ceres, the new Spanish Governor of Hispaniola, along with the conquistador Francisco Pizzaro. It is believed that Alonso died at the end of 1511.

It is particularly useful for deriving the yield curve ‚Äì the process of determining spot rate model inputs from observable bond market data. The affine class of term structure models implies the convenient form that log bond prices are linear functions of the spot rate (and potentially additional state variables).  Background  Start with a stochastic short rate model r(t) with dynamics: : dr(t)=\\\\mu(t,r(t)) \\\\, dt + \\\\sigma(t,r(t)) \\\\, dW(t) and a risk-free zero-coupon bond maturing at time T with price P(t,T) at time t. The price of a zero- coupon bond is given by:P(t,T) = \\\\mathbb{E}^{\\\\mathbb{Q}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\exp\\\\left[ -\\\\int_{t}^{T}r(t')dt' \\\\right] \\\\right\\\\\\\\}where T=t+\\\\tau, with \\\\tau being is the bond's maturity. The expectation is taken with respect to the risk-neutral probability measure \\\\mathbb{Q}. If the bond's price has the form: :P(t,T)=e^{A(t,T)-rB(t,T)} where A and B are deterministic functions, then the short rate model is said to have an affine term structure. The yield of a bond with maturity \\\\tau, denoted by y(t,\\\\tau), is given by:y(t,\\\\tau) = -{1\\\\over{\\\\tau}}\\\\log P(t,\\\\tau)  Feynman-Kac formula  For the moment, we have not yet figured out how to explicitly compute the bond's price; however, the bond price's definition implies a link to the Feynman-Kac formula, which suggests that the bond's price may be explicitly modeled by a partial differential equation. Assuming that the bond price is a function of x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n} latent factors leads to the PDE:-{\\\\partial P\\\\over{\\\\partial \\\\tau}} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\mu_{i}{\\\\partial P\\\\over{\\\\partial x_{i}}} + {1\\\\over{2}}\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\\\Omega_{ij}{\\\\partial^{2} P\\\\over{\\\\partial x_{i}\\\\partial x_{j}}} - rP = 0, \\\\quad P(0,x) = 1where \\\\Omega is the covariance matrix of the latent factors where the latent factors are driven by an Ito stochastic differential equation in the risk-neutral measure:dx = \\\\mu^{\\\\mathbb{Q}}dt + \\\\Sigma dW^{\\\\mathbb{Q}}, \\\\quad \\\\Omega = \\\\Sigma\\\\Sigma^{T}Assume a solution for the bond price of the form:P(\\\\tau,x) = \\\\exp\\\\left[A(\\\\tau) + x^{T}B(\\\\tau) \\\\right], \\\\quad A(0) = B_{i}(0) = 0The derivatives of the bond price with respect to maturity and each latent factor are:\\\\begin{aligned} {\\\\partial P\\\\over{\\\\partial \\\\tau}} &= \\\\left[ A'(\\\\tau) + x^{T}B'(\\\\tau)\\\\right]P \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\partial P\\\\over{\\\\partial x_{i}}} &= B_{i}(\\\\tau)P \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\partial^{2} P\\\\over{\\\\partial x_{i}\\\\partial x_{j}}} &= B_{i}(\\\\tau)B_{j}(\\\\tau)P\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned}With these derivatives, the PDE may be reduced to a series of ordinary differential equations:-\\\\left[A'(\\\\tau) + x^{T}B'(\\\\tau) \\\\right] + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\mu_{i}B_{i}(\\\\tau) + {1\\\\over{2}}\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\\\Omega_{ij}B_{i}(\\\\tau)B_{j}(\\\\tau) - r = 0, \\\\quad A(0) = B_{i}(0) = 0To compute a closed-form solution requires additional specifications.  Existence  Using Ito's formula we can determine the constraints on \\\\mu and \\\\sigma which will result in an affine term structure. Assuming the bond has an affine term structure and P satisfies the term structure equation, we get: : A_t(t,T)-(1+B_t(t,T))r-\\\\mu(t,r)B(t,T)+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^2(t,r)B^2(t,T)=0 The boundary value :P(T,T)=1 implies : \\\\begin{align} A(T,T)&=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ B(T,T)&=0 \\\\end{align} Next, assume that \\\\mu and \\\\sigma^2 are affine in r: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mu(t,r)&=\\\\alpha(t)r+\\\\beta(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma(t,r)&=\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma(t)r+\\\\delta(t)} \\\\end{align} The differential equation then becomes : A_t(t,T)-\\\\beta(t)B(t,T)+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\delta(t)B^2(t,T)-\\\\left[1+B_t(t,T)+\\\\alpha(t)B(t,T)-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\gamma(t)B^2(t,T)\\\\right]r=0 Because this formula must hold for all r, t, T, the coefficient of r must equal zero. : 1+B_t(t,T)+\\\\alpha(t)B(t,T)-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\gamma(t)B^2(t,T)=0 Then the other term must vanish as well. : A_t(t,T)-\\\\beta(t)B(t,T)+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\delta(t)B^2(t,T)=0 Then, assuming \\\\mu and \\\\sigma^2 are affine in r, the model has an affine term structure where A and B satisfy the system of equations: : \\\\begin{align} 1+B_t(t,T)+\\\\alpha(t)B(t,T)-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\gamma(t)B^2(t,T)&=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ B(T,T)&=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ A_t(t,T)-\\\\beta(t)B(t,T)+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\delta(t)B^2(t,T)&=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ A(T,T)&=0 \\\\end{align}  Models with ATS   Vasicek  The Vasicek model dr=(b-ar)\\\\,dt+\\\\sigma \\\\,dW has an affine term structure where : \\\\begin{align} p(t,T)&=e^{A(t,T)-B(t,T)r(t)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ B(t,T)&=\\\\frac{1}{a}\\\\left(1-e^{-a(T-t)}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ A(t,T)&=\\\\frac{(B(t,T)-T+t)(ab-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^2)}{a^2}-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2B^2(t,T)}{4a} \\\\end{align}  Arbitrage-Free Nelson-Siegel  One approach to affine term structure modeling is to enforce an arbitrage-free condition on the proposed model. In a series of papers, a proposed dynamic yield curve model was developed using an arbitrage-free version of the famous Nelson-Siegel model, which the authors label AFNS. To derive the AFNS model, the authors make several assumptions: # There are three latent factors corresponding to the level, slope, and curvature of the yield curve # The latent factors evolve according to multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The particular specifications differ based on the measure being used: ##dx = K^{\\\\mathbb{P}}(\\\\theta-x)dt + \\\\Sigma dW^{\\\\mathbb{P}} (Real-world measure \\\\mathbb{P}) ##dx = -K^{\\\\mathbb{Q}}xdt + \\\\Sigma dW^{\\\\mathbb{Q}} (Risk-neutral measure \\\\mathbb{Q}) # The volatility matrix \\\\Sigma is diagonal # The short rate is a function of the level and slope (r = x_{1} + x_{2}) From the assumed model of the zero-coupon bond price:P(\\\\tau,x) = \\\\exp\\\\left[A(\\\\tau) + x^{T}B(\\\\tau) \\\\right]The yield at maturity \\\\tau is given by:y(\\\\tau) = -{A(\\\\tau)\\\\over{\\\\tau}} - {x^{T}B(\\\\tau)\\\\over{\\\\tau}}And based on the listed assumptions, the set of ODEs that must be solved for a closed-form solution is given by:-\\\\left[A'(\\\\tau) + B'(\\\\tau)^{T}x \\\\right] - B(\\\\tau)^{T}K^{\\\\mathbb{Q}}x + {1\\\\over{2}}B(\\\\tau)^{T}\\\\Omega B(\\\\tau) - \\\\rho^{T}x = 0, \\\\quad A(0) = B_{i}(0) = 0where \\\\rho = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}^{T} and \\\\Omega is a diagonal matrix with entries \\\\Omega_{ii} = \\\\sigma_{i}^{2}. Matching coefficients, we have the set of equations:\\\\begin{aligned} -B'(\\\\tau) &= \\\\left(K^{\\\\mathbb{Q}}\\\\right)^{T}B(\\\\tau) + \\\\rho, \\\\quad B_{i}(0) = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ A'(\\\\tau) &= {1\\\\over{2}}B(\\\\tau)^{T}\\\\Omega B(\\\\tau), \\\\quad A(0) = 0 \\\\end{aligned}To find a tractable solution, the authors propose that K^{\\\\mathbb{Q}} take the form:K^{\\\\mathbb{Q}} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\lambda & -\\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\lambda \\\\end{pmatrix}Solving the set of coupled ODEs for the vector B(\\\\tau), and letting \\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\tau) = -{1\\\\over{\\\\tau}}B(\\\\tau), we find that:\\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\tau) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & {1-e^{-\\\\lambda\\\\tau}\\\\over{\\\\lambda \\\\tau}} & {1-e^{-\\\\lambda\\\\tau}\\\\over{\\\\lambda \\\\tau}} - e^{-\\\\lambda\\\\tau} \\\\end{pmatrix}^{T}Then x^{T}\\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\tau) reproduces the standard Nelson- Siegel yield curve model. The solution for the yield adjustment factor \\\\mathcal{A}(\\\\tau) = -{1\\\\over{\\\\tau}}A(\\\\tau) is more complicated, found in Appendix B of the 2007 paper, but is necessary to enforce the arbitrage-free condition.  Average expected short rate  One quantity of interest that may be derived from the AFNS model is the average expected short rate (AESR), which is defined as:\\\\text{AESR} \\\\equiv {1\\\\over{\\\\tau}}\\\\int_{t}^{t+\\\\tau}\\\\mathbb{E}_{t}(r_{s})ds = y(\\\\tau) - \\\\text{TP}(\\\\tau)where \\\\mathbb{E}_{t}(r_{s}) is the conditional expectation of the short rate and \\\\text{TP}(\\\\tau) is the term premium associated with a bond of maturity \\\\tau. To find the AESR, recall that the dynamics of the latent factors under the real-world measure \\\\mathbb{P} are:dx = K^{\\\\mathbb{P}}(\\\\theta-x)dt + \\\\Sigma dW^{\\\\mathbb{P}}The general solution of the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is:x_{t} = \\\\theta + e^{-K^{\\\\mathbb{P}}t}(x_{0}-\\\\theta) + \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-K^{\\\\mathbb{P}}(t-t')}\\\\Sigma dW^{\\\\mathbb{P}}Note that e^{-K^{\\\\mathbb{P}}t} is the matrix exponential. From this solution, it is possible to explicitly compute the condition expectation of the factors at time t+\\\\tau as:\\\\mathbb{E}_{t}(x_{t+\\\\tau}) = \\\\theta + e^{-K^{\\\\mathbb{P}}\\\\tau}(x_{t}-\\\\theta)Noting that r_{t} = \\\\rho^{T}x_{t}, the general solution for the AESR may be found analytically:{1\\\\over{\\\\tau}}\\\\int_{t}^{t+\\\\tau}\\\\mathbb{E}_{t}(r_{s})ds = \\\\rho^{T}\\\\left[ \\\\theta + {1\\\\over{\\\\tau}}\\\\left( K^{\\\\mathbb{P}} \\\\right)^{-1}\\\\left(I - e^{-K^{\\\\mathbb{P}}\\\\tau}\\\\right)(x_{t}-\\\\theta) \\\\right]  References   Further reading  * Category:Interest rates Category:Financial models Category:Fixed income analysis Category:Stochastic models Category:Short-rate models Category:Mathematical and quantitative methods (economics) Category:Mathematical finance ","title":"Affine term structure model"},{"id":"37988476","text":"DVB Bank SE is part of the DZ BANK Group and a specialist in international transportation finance, based in Frankfurt/Main, Germany.

After World War II, DVKB, specialized in cargo deferral, which was fixed by law. 1949 after the unification of the two main locations in Frankfurt and Hamburg, the head office in Frankfurt was established. It also operated numerous branches in other German cities. In 1988, the DVKB was placed on the stock exchange, the German Federal Railways held 75.1 percent stake. In 1991, it was named Deutsche Verkehrs-Bank AG (German traffic Bank AG), in 1997 named Deutsche VerkehrsBank AG (German Transport AG) and 2002 changed its name again to DVB Bank AG.

First reports in early 1942 had been made by the Polish officer Witold Pilecki. Tabeau's report was known as that of the \\"Polish major\\" in the Auschwitz Protocols. After the war he became a noted cardiologist in Krak√≥w.http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl/artykul/2191774,doc-dr-hab-jerzy- tabeau,id,t.html Tabeau was a member of the Union of Armed Struggle, ZwiƒÖzek Walki Zbrojnej (ZWZ) and had worked in the Polish underground under the pseudonym \\"Jerzy Weso≈Çowski\\" in Krak√≥w, distributing underground press. He was captured and taken to the Gestapo's Montelupich Prison in Krak√≥w. On 26 March 1942 he was transferred to Auschwitz, and - still under his false name - registered under the number 27273. He soon fell ill with pneumonia and pleurisy, and was placed in the camp hospital. After recovering he joined the hospital staff as a nurse. In the summer of 1942 he came down with typhus and was selected by Nazi doctor Dr. Josef Klehr to be included in the list of patients to be killed in the gas chambers. However, thanks to the intervention by the Polish block elder, Alfred Stossel, he managed to escape death.Hermann Langbein People in Auschwitz Page 433 2004 \\"The Pole Jerzy Tabeau owes his life to such a moment. In the summer of 1942 he was selected by Dr. Entress.

The escape was pre-planned in July 1943 and originally intended to include five prisoners escape. As Cieliczko was in the camp under his given name, not a pseudonym, it was essential to first warn Cieliczko's mother in Zakopane to go into hiding.

In December 1943 Tabeau proceeded to prepare a report about the camp. The work was completed in early 1944. In March, on orders of the Underground, he left Krak√≥w on a mission to London to give testimony in person about the Polish resistance and confirm to the Allies the truth about the Nazi genocide. The journey took place without incident. After returning to Poland he went to the Nowy SƒÖcz area to form a \\"Socialist Death Battalion.\\" During one of the battles near Jordan√≥w in October 1944 Tabeau was wounded in the head, leaving him partially paralysed. However he lived to see the end of the war. After 1945 he settled in Krak√≥w, completing his medical studies and graduating from the Jagiellonian University. He became an assistant professor of Medicine, and a well-known cardiologist in Krak√≥w. Tabeau's report Reports of the German genocide were emerging, including the 10 December 1942 address by the Polish Government in Exile to the League of Nations, and evidence from escaped Jewish inmate from Majdanek, Dionys Lenard.Les archives de la Shoah: - Page 189 Jacques Fredj, Centre de documentation juive contemporaine - 1998 \\"D'apr√®s les t√©moignages plus importants concernant la Shoah, le r√©cit du Juif slovaque Dionys Lenard, publi√© en h√©breu (et plus tard en polonais et en allemand), ainsi que le livre de Halina Birenbaum, publi√© en polonais, en allemand et en ...\\" However, as yet there was limited information about the conveyor-belt of death at Auschwitz. Tabeau compiled his report between December 1943 and January 1944. It was copied using a stencil machine in Geneva in August 1944, and was distributed by the Polish government-in-exile and the Bratislava Working Group, reaching Czechoslovak diplomat Jarom√≠r Kopeck√Ω in Switzerland.Zolt√°n Szab√≥ (2011), p. 90 This was eventually included in the Auschwitz Protocols as the 19-page \\"No 2.

Other eye witness reports Several escapees from the camp had already passed on information to the outside: On 20 June 1942 three Poles Kazimierz Piechowski, Stanis≈Çaw Gustaw Jaster, J√≥zef Lempart and the Ukrainian Eugeniusz Bendera escaped, with a report by Witold Pilecki passing his information to the Polish Home Army (AK). On 27 April 1943 Witold Pilecki himself, a Polish Home Army agent who had deliberately infiltrated the camp in order to found ZwiƒÖzek Organizacji Wojskowej (ZOW) cells inside it and to take measures against the German extermination policy of the Polish intelligentsia, escaped together with two other Polish soldiers, Jan Redzej and Edward Ciesielski. Each compiled a separate report for the Polish Home Army. Witold's report was translated into English but was filed away by the British government with a note appended stating there was no indication as to the source's reliability. On 2 November 1943 Kazimirez Halori, another Polish prisoner, escaped and passed information to the Polish Socialist Party. Natalia Zarembina assembled testimony from another Polish escaper and others into a report entitled \\"Auschwitz‚ÄîCamp of Death\\" which was published in English in 1943 in London.

This was the final film of actors Dan Duryea and Nan Leslie. Plot Test pilot Fred Norwood is flying the experimental X-109 (actually a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter) jet aircraft along with his chase plane. During the flight testing, Norwood finds himself pursued by a flying saucer and has to engage in a tricky series of aerobatics to protect his aircraft. Once on the ground Norwood is informed that the radar tracking of his aircraft picked up no other craft near him except his own chase plane. Though Norwood insists on what he saw his superiors who have monitored his vital signs think he has had a series of hallucinations and order him off the project. Blanchard, the USAF pilot of the chase plane comes out of a room in an unusual frightened and nervous state and parrots lines about not seeing another aircraft; the event was merely an aerial inversion. When Blanchard falters with his explanation he is prompted of what to say by members of the panel in the room. Angered and determined, Norwood decides to prove what he saw by patrolling the area in a North American P-51 Mustang equipped with laser radar until the point of exhaustion. As Norwood sleeps, his best friend Joe Vetry, a fellow pilot who is married to Norwood's sister Dorothy takes off in the Mustang when radar picks up an unidentified flying object. Norwood and Dorothy view Joe's aircraft vanish off the screen; later Federal Aviation Administration crash investigators tell Norwood that their opinion is his friend's Mustang disintegrated in midair in a manner similar to some accounts of the Mantell UFO incident. Norwood finds himself summoned to Washington D.C. where Hank Peters, a member of an influential unnamed agency of the United States Government not only believes his account but shows him a sketch that Norwood identifies as the same craft that buzzed his aircraft. Peters tells Norwood that the sketch was provided from intelligence sources based in Red China. Due to Norwood's familiarity with a variety of aircraft, he is asked if he will accompany Peters and two scientists who will be parachuted into Red China. Peters informs him there are reliable sources that say two humanoids escaped the craft but later died, probably through exposure to the Earth's bacteria. Due to their rapid deterioration, their bodies were cremated. At the drop zone they are met by Chinese American agent Sam Archibald who leads them to the craft that is hidden in the ruins of a Catholic Church. Due to the communists destroying the church, the local population will assist the Americans in any way possible. On travelling to their destination and evading units of the People's Liberation Army they come across a party of Russian scientists led by their own version of Agent Peters. The two parties cooperate in investigating the craft.

In a 12 April 1966 reply the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense informed Fairbanks that they had a \\"negative reaction\\" to Project Saucer. They recommend that the screenplay delete reference to the CIA saying it would not be appropriate to place one of their men in the position fictionalised, the UFO investigation was not set up factually, the Air Force General character at the aircraft testing was an necessarily uncomplimentary character and would not act as he does in the script, it was not clear just what part the USAF played in the aircraft testing, any one of the aircraft manufacturers would clarify the opening sequence and the USAF should not be utilised or included in the air drop in China.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA- RDP88-01365R000300080004-5.pdf Fairbanks incorporated the changes in the finished screenplay though co-screenwriter, associate producer and special effects expert John P.

Steinweis, Art, Ideology & Economics in Nazi Germany: The Reich Chambers of Music, Theater, and the Visual Arts, University of North Carolina Press, 1993, p. 24 Promulgated in his 1930 edict Against Negro Culture, the Thuringian foreshadowed the co-ordination of culture that was to happen under the Nazi government.Strobl, The Swastika and the Stage, p. 116 Entartete Musik would continue Ziegler's crusade against jazz,David Blake, Hanns Eisler, Hanns Eisler: A Miscellany, Routledge, 1995, p. 398 whilst also condemning Ernst Krenek's opera ' as the archetype of Weimar decadence and miscegenation.Richard S.
