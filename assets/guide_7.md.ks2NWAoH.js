Family Origins  The Dukedom of the Infantado had been in the hands of the Mendoza family since the very first duke, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y Figueroa. The Mendoza family rose to power when it merged with the House of Lasso de la Vega through the marriage of Leonor Lasso de la Vega, the last direct member of that line, and Admiral Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, the admiral of Castile. He inherited the title from his grandmother, Ana de Mendoza y Enríquez de Cabrera.  Biography  Rodrigo actively fought in the Portuguese Restoration War as a member of Philip IV of Spain's staff. He also participated in putting down the Catalan Revolt and in the Siege of Lérida. He was later named the Spanish ambassador to Rome, Governor of Milán, and Viceroy of Sicily. He died in 1657 without leaving any heirs. As such, the title of Duke of the Infantado passed on to his sister, the Duchess of Pastrana, Catalina Gómez de Sandoval y Mendoza which united the two houses and increased the power of the family.  Marriage  Rodrigo married in 1630 with María de Silva y Guzmán, the daughter of Ruy III Gómez de Silva y Mendoza de la Cerda, the Duque de Pastrana. The couple never conceived any children.

Baháʼí Faith - monotheistic religion founded by Baháʼu'lláh in 19th-century Persia, emphasizing the spiritual unity of all humankind. In the Baháʼí Faith, religious history is seen to have unfolded through a series of divine messengers, each of whom established a religion that was suited to the needs of the time and the capacity of the people. Humanity is understood to be in a process of collective evolution, and the need of the present time is for the gradual establishment of peace, justice and unity on a global scale.

Standing high and long, the dam is the primary component of Hydro-Québec's Sainte-Marguerite 3 hydroelectric project. The dam is the second highest in Quebec and the hydraulic head afforded to its power plant is also the largest in the province. Construction on the dam began in 1994 after seven years of studies and planning. Before construction began on the dam proper, a high, long cofferdam was raised to divert the river through a tunnel west of the dam site. An average of 500 workers and a maximum of 1,200, most of whom lived in a construction camp that opened in January 1995, were employed at the dam site during construction. After the cutting of some 233 million board feet of lumber from the future reservoir site, the dam began to impound water in 1998 and finally reached capacity in 2001. The dam and reservoir lie in a very remote region, and an long access road had to be built to facilitate transportation to the construction site. No area residents were displaced as a result of the remote location, but a large portion of the territory of the indigenous Innu people was flooded. In 1994, Hydro-Québec paid the local Innu CA$20.9 million as compensation. Full project completion was reached in 2002 at a cost of CA$2.4 billion, making it one of the most significant 21st century hydroelectric developments in North America. After the dam was finished, temporary facilities used during construction were dismantled to ease impact on the local environment. The main workers' camp was actually demolished in 2001, a year before the project's final completion. These areas were replanted with some six hundred thousand trees. Hydroelectricity generation began in 2003. As of 2003, the dam was projected to generate about 2.73 TWh of electricity per year, or an average output of just over 310 megawatts (MW). The dam impounds a long, reservoir with a capacity of about . Excess water is released through a set of outlet works at the base of the dam, with a capacity of , and an emergency spillway about northwest of the dam. The spillway's three gates have a total capacity of , and its outflow rejoins the river about below the base of the dam.

They are a sub-group of the Serer ethnic group found in Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania. Although ethnically Serers, they do not speak the Serer language but one of the Cangin languages. Their language is Palor. Other names Other names for the Palor people include Waro (the name for themselves), Palors-Sile, Waro-Waro, Falor, Sili, Sili-Sili (the name they use for their language). The word Sili is a Palor word for Serer. History According to Atlas National du Sénégal (Institut Géographique National 1977), their population was 5000. By 2007, their population was 10,700. They are found in the area of Diander, such as: Gorom, Sébikotane, Tieudem, Mbidjeum, etc. The Palors are a member of the Cangin people (those who speak the Cangin languages) and a sub-group of the Serer people. In their oral history, the Palor and Ndut accepts a common origin and language. Their tradition went on to say that, the Palors moved southwards from the village of Palo (in the Ndut Region). Another account attributes the separation of the Palor and Ndut to a disagreement between two brothers, which led to the younger brother moving north out of the Palor Region in order to form the Ndut ethnic group. In similarity, the Saafi and Noon traditions states a common ancestral heritage. The Noon people used to return and pray at the Sacred wood they left behind in the Safen Region after they had migrated north. From a wider perspective, the Cangin people are part of the Serer group, and some of these group were defeated in the 11th century by the Almoravids and their African Muslim coalition army, when they advanced in Tekrur (present-day Futa Toro), resulting in the southward migration of some of these people, who refused to accept Islam (see Serer history (medieval era to present) and Timeline of Serer history). The Palors, like many of the Cangin speakers residing on the Cayor and its borders, have a long reputation for waging wars against the DamelTitle for the king of Cayor in pre-colonial times of Cayor, the Portuguese as well as the French. The name of their king was the Fara Ndout (variation : \\"Fara Ndut\\"). He was elected by the Damel from the royal family, and a candidate to the throne of Cayor. He had authority over the Nduts, the Palors and the region of Diander. In some cases, he was hardly listened to. They are among the oldest inhabitants of Senegal, especially around Pout area (var : Put). Culture The Palor language is classified as one of the Cangin languages which is closely related to the Ndut language and distantly related to Serer proper. Many Palors are farmers who grow millet (a staple food among the Serers). They also grow and sell peanuts, manioc (cassava), mangoes, tomatoes, bissap (similar to the hibiscus flower), etc. Many Palors also work in the cities of Thiès and Dakar and even sometimes further afield at Kaolack in order to earn income and support their families. Unlike the other Serer groups, the Palors, especially those from poorer families, are at a disadvantage educationally, because there is little or no educational facilities in their own region. As a result, they have to send their children to boarding schools in Safene country (the lands of the Saafi people), such as Sangué, etc. Lack of educational facilities has resulted in Palor children not receiving formal education. Religion Like many of the Cangin language speakers such as the Safene, etc., they adhere to the tenets of Serer religion. They make offerings of the harvest firstfruits to the ancestral spirits (Pangool - in Serer religion) and retain the \\"chef coutumier\\" (\\"one who performs prayers to the spirits\\" \\\\- the Serer Lamanes in the old religious sense, can also be the Saltigues, see Timeline of Serer history). Their traditional and religious songs are also preserved, usually sung in the Ndut language and forms the basis of Serer hymns. Some Palors are Christians or Muslims. Like most Serer Muslims, their conversion to Islam is very recent. Though there are some Palor Muslim and Christian communities, syncretism with the Serer religion is prevalent.

Catalina Gómez de Sandoval y Mendoza (1616–1686) was the 8th Duchess of the Infantado, gaining the title after the death of her brother in 1657. She held the title until her own death in 1686. She also served in various important palace roles at the court of Charles II of Spain. She was also the Duchess Consort of Pastrana.  Family Origins  As a member of the prestigious Mendoza family, Catalina was next in line to receive the Dukedom of the Infantado after the death of her brother, Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar Gómez de Sandoval y Mendoza, the 7th Duke who was childless. The Dukedom had been in the hands of the Mendoza family since the very first duke, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y Figueroa. The Mendoza family rose to power when it merged with the House of Lasso de la Vega through the marriage of Leonor Lasso de la Vega, the last direct member of that line, and Admiral Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, the admiral of Castile.  Biography  Catalina preferred to live in Pastrana with her husband rather than Guadalajara, the traditional seat of the Dukes of the Infantado. She filed suit for the Dukedom of Lerma against Diego Gómez de Sandoval, the Conde de Saldaña, the only nephew of the first Duke of Lerma and son of Catalina's father. Of issue was the fact that Diego had remarried. in 1659 at the house of the Duke of Alba, it was announced that the 5th Duke of Lerma would be Diego Gómez de Sandoval, but as he had no line of succession for lack of heirs, the Dukedom would pass, upon his death, to his sister Catalina. In 1668, Diego Gómez de Sandoval died and Catalina Gómez de Sandoval y Mendoza who was already the Duchess of the Infantado and of Pastrana, gained the Dukedom of Lerma as well. The Duke of Medinaceli continued to fight against this decision until 1677 when all matters were settled in favor of Catalina. In addition to amassing hereditary titles, Catalina also built the Convento de los Capuchinos de Jadraque, Donated much to the Carmelites of Guadalajara (Where her daughter Leonor became a member), and bought a house for the Dukes of the Infantado in Chamartín de la Rosa, Madrid where in 1808, Napoleon Bonaparte would stay when his troops occupied the city.  Marriage  In 1630, Catalina married Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar de Silva y Mendoza, the fourth Duke of Pastrana. This made her the Duchess Consort of Pastrana and united both dukedoms under one house. They had the following children: * Gregorio María de Silva y Mendoza, 9th Duke of the Infantado, inherited from his mother. * Leonor de Silva y Mendoza, joined the Carmelites of Guadalajara. * José de Silva y Mendoza * Gaspar de Silva y Mendoza  References  *Much of the information on this page was translated from its Spanish equivalent.

The albums feature original songs as well as covers – many sharing a surfing or summer theme – by a range of popular artists. Track listing Reception Entertainment Weeklys Mike Flaherty gave Volume 1 a \\"B\\" rating. He called the compilation less sanctimonious than traditional benefit albums, noting the number of celebrity artists, and he singled-out Pearl Jam's cover of the \\"loopy\\" \\"Gremmie Out of Control\\" and Helmet's \\"ham-fisted\\" cover of \\"Army of Me\\". Marcus Greville of the Green Left Weekly stated that due to the inconsistent song styles the album was \\"appealing, but difficult to become engaged in\\". He gave the album 7/10, and recommended the album as a \\"gift for a surfer friend\\". David Yonke of the Toledo Blade called it \\"one of the most enjoyable compilation albums to be issued in a while\\", but noted that the \\"MOM\\" abbreviation should have been \\"MOMO\\". Volume 2 received a \\"B-\\" from Entertainment Weeklys Steven Mirkin. He preferred the \\"freshness\\" of ska bands like 311 and Mighty Mighty Bosstones to the more surf rock-inspired tracks, calling the Beach Boys' \\"Summer in Paradise\\" \\"especially tired\\". He commended Dick Dale's \\"Misirlou '97\\" as being the only track to successfully bridge the old and new styles, and called Jewel's \\"V-12 Cadillac\\" \\"a loser, ecologically and musically.\\" In his review of Volume 3, Steve Crawford of the Houston Chronicle called the series both a \\"terrific product\\" due to the disparate musicians working to help the environment, and \\"tepid bathwater\\" due to many \\"halfhearted\\" tracks. He called the covers of \\"Little Deuce Coupe\\" from Brian Setzer, \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" from Allison Moorer and \\"Summer in the City\\" from the Butthole Surfers as \\"tame and routine\\". He viewed some songs more favorably, calling Everclear's \\"Walk, Don't Run\\" \\"rip-roaring\\", and Sprung Monkey's \\"Coconut\\" \\"clever and bouncy\\". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the Surfrider Foundation credit for compiling exclusive \\"first-rate\\" tracks performed by major artists, but called the result a balance \\"between the good and the mediocre\\". He was the most positive about the \\"frazzled beach party song\\" \\"Electric Music and the Summer People\\" by Beck, the \\"strangely ambitious\\" \\"The Whale Song\\" from Pearl Jam, and the collaboration between Snoop Dogg & Rage Against the Machine, \\"Snoop Bounce\\". Also mentioned favorably were \\"Little Deuce Coupe\\" from Brian Setzer & Brian Wilson, \\"Walk, Don't Run\\" from Everclear \\"Winter Waves\\" from Chris Isaak, and the \\"fun punk throwaway\\" of the Beastie Boys' \\"Nothing to Say\\". Sprung Monkey's \\"Coconut\\" was mentioned as one of the few \\"trying moments\\", and he did point out that tracks from Paul McCartney and James Taylor had been previously released, but felt \\"the good intentions outweigh the end result\\". Ultimately he felt that the varied nature of the tracks would prevent listeners from enjoying the entire album, but that it was still more enjoyable than typical benefit albums.

From 1997 to 1998, he held a fellowship at the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies. Albright Institute In 1980, Gitin became the director of the Albright Institute of Archaeological Research (AIAR) in Jerusalem. While at AIAR, Gitin and Trude Dothan directed excavations at the Phillistine city of Tel Miqne-Ekron, conducting 14 seasons between 1981 and 1996. Gitin's research at Ekron demonstrated that, contrary to the previous scholarly consensus, the Philistines flourished in the eastern Mediterranean littoral until the late 7th century BCE, extending their documented history by 400 years. He also showed that the extensive olive oil industry at Ekron in the 7th century BCE, the largest production complex of its kind in antiquity excavated to date, was the direct result of Ekron coming under the control of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Based on the late Phillistine sequence at Ekron, he has argued that the disappearance of the Phillistines following the destruction of their cities by the Neo-Babylonian Empire can be explained as the result of a process of acculturation. The most significant find of the Tel Miqne excavations is the 7th century BCE Ekron royal dedicatory inscription, in which the name of the city is mentioned, confirming the identification of Tel Miqne with biblical Ekron. The inscription also contained a list of five of the kings of Ekron, two of whom are mentioned in the Neo-Assyrian Royal Annals of the late 8th and 7th centuries BCE. This makes the inscription one of the primary documents for establishing the chronology of events relating to the end of the late biblical period, especially the history of the Philistines. Gitin and Dothan are finishing the preparation of the materials from 14 seasons of excavation at Ekron for publication.

It is placed in the subgenus Theelothuria, making its full name Holothuria (Theelothuria) spinifera. In India it is known as \\"cheena attai\\" or \\"raja attai\\". It lives in tropical regions of the west Indo-Pacific Ocean at depths ranging from . It is fished commercially to produce \\"beche-de- mer\\".  Description  Holothuria spinifera has a cylindrical body, dark brown on the upper side and pale brown beneath. The skin is densely covered with sharp conical protuberances. It can grow to a length of .  Biology  Holothuria spinifera is a scavenger, sifting through the sediment on the seabed with its tentacles. It usually spends the day buried in the sediment and emerges at night. Research has been undertaken into the reproduction and life cycle of Holothuria spinifera with a view to breeding it commercially for aquaculture or for sea ranching. In a study in India, several adults were caught by hand and placed in a tank. Spawning took place spontaneously with a male liberating sperm in a white strand. A female responded by producing a spurt of eggs that were fertilized in the water column. The larvae were pelagic and developed rapidly, being fed on microalgae for the first ten days. For the next four days they passed through the non-feeding, barrel-shaped, doliolaria stage and moved about in the tank. They then settled on the bottom and underwent metamorphosis into pentactula larvae with five short tentacles at the front and two tube feet at the back. By day twenty, the tentacles and feet were more distinct and the first thorny protuberances were visible on the body. In the study, mortality of the larvae was about 95%, but this high rate was partly due to predation by copepods which the researchers were unable to eliminate from the tank. Other studies have investigated how best to stimulate spawning and the optimum conditions of temperature, pH and salinity for rearing the larvae, the best diet to feed and how to stimulate them to settle.  Ecology  In Vietnam, a small bivalve shell, Entovalva nhatrangensis, is found living as an endosymbiont inside the oesophagus of Holothuria spinifera. The mollusc is a filter feeder and extracts nourishment from sediment that the sea cucumber has swallowed.J. Lützen, B. Berland & G.A.Bristow, Morphology of an endosymbiotic bivalve, Entovalva nhatrangensis (Bristow, Berland, Schander & Vo, 2010) (Galeommatoidea); Molluscan Research 31(2): 114–124 ; ISSN 1323-5818  Fishery  In India, both Holothuria spinifera and the sandfish (Holothuria scabra) are harvested for human consumption. It is best gathered by skin diving and handled gently. Most however is caught by trawling but the resulting quality is lower than when it is brought to the surface by divers. This is because, if handled roughly it is liable to eviscerate, voiding its viscera and respiratory tree. Some of the brown sandfish caught are dried and exported as beche-de-mer, particularly to China. They used to be an important article of trade but the volumes exported have diminished over the years. The sea cucumbers are easy to gather, slow to mature and need to congregate for successful reproduction and over exploitation has reduced populations. Further research has been undertaken into the hatchery technology necessary for successful rearing and it is hoped to use juveniles to seed suitable areas of the sea bed to increase the size of populations.

It was first described in 2010 and its specific name \\"nhatrangensis\\" derives from the locality where it was originally found, Nha Trang Bay in Vietnam. It lives inside the oesophagus of certain species of sea cucumbers. It is considered to be an endosymbiont rather than a parasite because it does not harm its host. Description Entovalva nhatrangensis can grow to about in length. It has a very small, delicate shell which is internal, being entirely enclosed by large folds of the mantle which fuse above the hinge. The gills are small but their structure is similar to those of other free-living bivalves. The foot extends permanently from the ventral side of the animal. This is relatively large compared to other bivalves and contains the visceral mass and the gonads. J. Lützen, B. Berland & G.A.Bristow, Morphology of an endosymbiotic bivalve, Entovalva nhatrangensis (Bristow, Berland, Schander & Vo, 2010) (Galeommatoidea); Molluscan Research 31(2): 114–124 ; ISSN 1323-5818 Entovalva nhatrangensis can be distinguished from the other three previously described species in the genus Entovalva by the different shape of its body and foot, and by the fact that its outer body epithelium is distinctively folded. Biology Entovalva nhatrangensis is an endosymbiont living inside the oesophagus of a sea cucumber. In a research study undertaken in 2010, 23 sea cucumbers known as brown sandfish (Holothuria spinifera) were gathered from shallow waters in Nha Trang Bay in Vietnam. Of these, 22 were found to harbour the bivalve in their oesophagus. The average number of molluscs per host was 84 with a range of 1 to 167. Another sea cucumber, Holothuria leucospilota, also acts as a host to the bivalve but of 30 specimens collected from the same locality, only one was found to harbour any of them, and that one contained just 5 molluscs. It was at first surmised that Entovalva nhatrangensis might absorb nutrients through its epithelium. This idea was rejected however because the surface of the mantle is covered by a thin cuticle, which would make absorption difficult. The stomach was found to contain diatoms, therefore it is likely that the bivalve uses its gills to filter them and other fine organic particles from the contents of the sea cucumber's gut in which it is immersed. Entovalva nhatrangensis is a protandric hermaphrodite. This means that it starts life as a male and later becomes a female. Fertilization takes place when a male inserts spermatophores (bundles of sperm) into the gill cavity of a female. It is unclear how this is done but it seems likely that the male, always smaller than the female, makes its way into the siphon of the female to deposit them in the required position. The eggs are fertilized as they emerge from the genital pore into the siphon. The resulting larvae are brooded in the siphon until they are released as D-larvae with their rudimentary shells already formed. It is surmised that the larvae pass through the sea cucumbers gut and out through its anus before becoming planktonic for a period.

For his literary works Thom used Sloth as a nom de plume. Life Thom worked in the piece goods department of Jardine, Matheson & Co. where he acquired a knowledge of the Chinese language. When hostilities began between the British and the ruling Chinese Qing dynasty in late 1839, Thom, along with other Chinese translators including John Robert Morrison and Karl Gützlaff provided the necessary language interface between the warring factions. In July 1840, during the First Opium War, Thom sailed north from Canton aboard HMS Blonde as translator to Captain Thomas Bourchier. The ship anchored outside Namoy (modern day Kinmen, formerly also known as Quemoy) to deliver a letter from British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston laying out demands for the opening of China to foreign trade. After Bourchier noticed cannons being mounted on a nearby fort, Thom rowed towards the shore in a small boat carrying a placard warning that if the ship was fired on, Bourchier would retaliate. A number of Chinese from a mob gathered on the shore swam towards Thom's boat and he narrowly missed being hit by an arrow and musket fire as he shouted out the warning written on the placard. Bourchier made good on his promise and shelled the fort and nearby warships before eventually withdrawing. In 1841, Thom assisted the British during the expedition up the Broadway River from Macao to Canton.Bernard, William Dallas; Hall, William Hutcheon (1847). The Nemesis in China (3rd ed.).

Operations =Andhra Pradesh= The Ravva oil and gas field in the Krishna- Godavari Basin was developed in partnership with Cairn India, ONGC, Videocon and Ravva Oil, under a production sharing contract (PSC) that runs until 2019. Currently, eight unmanned offshore platforms are being operated. A 225-acre onshore processing facility at Surasaniyanam processes natural gas and crude oil from the Ravva field. The Ravva onshore terminal operates to the internationally environmental standard – ISO 14001 – and has the capacity to handle of oil per day, per day at standard conditions of natural gas and per day of injection water. The terminal also has the capacity to store of crude oil onshore. The Ravva field has produced more than of crude and sold of gas; about thrice the initial estimates. During the financial year, the plant uptime was 99.7% demonstrating superb operational efficiency. The asset recorded 1.61 million LTI free hours during the year. The offshore production platform at Ravva received the Oil Industry Safety Award for the year 2010–11. =Gujarat= In 2002, gas production commenced from the Lakshmi gas field, which is situated in Block CB/OS-2 in the Cambay Basin of the west coast of India in the Gulf of Khambhat. The Gauri offshore gas field was discovered in 2001 and came on-stream in 2004. CB-X, a marginal gas field in the transition zone of the CB/OS-2 block was in production between June 2007 and August 2009. The Lakshmi and Gauri fields commenced production of oil in addition to its gas production in 2005. The CB/OS-2 Block has completed 10 years of production and crossed a cumulative production of over of oil equivalent hydrocarbons. Safety and operational integrity have been a strong area of focus for the CB/OS-2 asset operations team. The asset team recorded 0.93 million Lost Time Incident (LTI) free hours and delivered facilities uptime of 99.9% during the financial year 2012–13. The block has recorded more than nine million safe work hours over the last seven years. =Rajasthan= The MangalaMangala crude output can be ramped up to 150,000 bpd: Cairn field in Rajasthan,Cairn's Rajasthan Field May Yield $3 Billion a Year which was discovered in January 2004, is the largest onshore oil discovery in India in more than 20 years. The Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya (MBA) fields have gross recoverable oil reserves and resources of over one bn boe. This includes proven plus probable (2P) gross reserves and resources of 636 mm boe with a further 308 mm boe or more of EOR resource potential. The Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya (MBA) fields have gross recoverable oil reserves and resources of approximately one billion barrels. Production from the Rajasthan Block currently contributes more than 23% of India's domestic production. Cairn India plans to drill in excess of 450 wells in the Rajasthan block over a three-year period; includes 100 Exploration and Appraisal (E&A;) wells and the balance as development wells to sustain and enhance production volumes. Cairn India made its 26th discovery in the RJ-ON-90/1 block in Rajasthan. Oil Discovery in Rajasthan Cairn India's renewed exploration efforts resulted in an oil discovery, the 26th discovery so far in the RJ- ON-90/1 block, following recent policy clarity by Government of India (GoI) to conduct exploration activity in development blocks. The Management Committee approved the exploration work programme for the RJON-90/1 block on 14 February 2013, post which Cairn India, the Operator of the block, commenced the drilling of its first Exploration well, Raageshwari-South-1, on 25 February 2013 located in the southern part of the block. Mangala : At Mangala, a total of 148 development wells have been drilled and completed with 96 producers and 33 injectors operationalised. The Company has successfully drilled and completed 11 horizontal wells at MangalaMangala field is producing at plateau rates; infill wells are planned this year for sustaining and extending plateau andgoing forward, the Company intends to bring other wells on stream in a staged manner. Bhagyam: Bhagyam is the second largest field in the Rajasthan block, with an approved production plateau of of oil per day. A total of 62 development wells have been drilled till date with 21 producers and four injectors operational; 12 producer wells are yet to be drilled. Bhagyam field is expected to ramp up to approved rate in H2 FY2013-14; and additional wells are planned this year. Both Mangala and Bhagyam are connected to the Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT), which processes the crude oil from the Rajasthan fields. Aishwariya: The Aishwariya field is the third largest discovery in the Rajasthan block. Following an assessment of higher production potential and design optimisation due to increased reserves and resources, Cairn India has commenced development work in the field. Now Aishwariya field has commenced oil production and is the fifth oil field in the Rajasthan block to come online. The oil production from Aishwariya field was inaugurated on 23 March 2013, by the Hon’ble Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Dr M VeerappaMoily in Barmer, Rajasthan in the presence of the Hon’ble Chief Minister Shri Ashok Gehlot, the Hon’ble Union Minister of State of Petroleum and Natural Gas Smt. P. Lakshmi. The field will achieve a gradual and safe ramp up to reach the currently approved FDP rate of of oil per day. Raageshwari Deep Gas Field: The Raageshwari Deep Gas field is meant to supply gas to meet the energy requirements at the MPT and the Mangala Development Pipeline, which runs approximately 670 km from Barmer to Viramgam to Salaya and then on to Bhogat, near Jamnagar, on the Arabian Sea coast. Saraswati and Raageshwari Fields: The Saraswati Field, which commenced production in May 2011, is currently producing at a rate of of oil per day. Till date, it has produced over of oil. This oil is processed at the MPT, and blended with the Mangala oil which is sold through the pipeline. The marginal oil field at Raageshwari also commenced production in March 2012. The Raageshwari and Saraswati fields continue to cumulatively contribute over of oil per day towards the total production from the block. Cairn India plans to drill in excess of 450 wells in the Rajasthan block over a three-year period; includes 100 Exploration and Appraisal (E&A;) wells and the balance as development wells to sustain and enhance production. Cairn India commenced gas sales from the Raageshwari field on 23 March =Commencement of Sale of Gas – Rajasthan Block= On 23 March 2013, The Cairn-ONGC Joint Venture (JV) commenced commercial sale of gas from the Rajasthan Block (RJ-ON-90/1). Initial commercial volumes will be about at standard conditions per day. The gas sales was inaugurated by the Hon’ble Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Dr M VeerappaMoily in Barmer, Rajasthan in the presence of the Hon’ble Chief Minister Shri Ashok Gehlot, the Hon’ble Union Minister of State of Petroleum and Natural Gas Smt. P. Lakshmi. The RJ- ON-90/1 block currently produces about of gas per day from the Raageshwari Deep Gas field and as associated gas along with crude oil from the Mangala and Bhagyam fields. The continued exploration program in the block targets several other gas prospects that are expected to add to the production of natural gas from the block over the years. This is expected to pave the way in future for developing the state of Rajasthan as a gas-based economy. =Midstream operations= The Mangala Processing Terminal: The Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT) spread over an area of 1.6 km2 and is located 40 km from the nearest town, Barmer. The MPT processes crude oil extracted from the Rajasthan fields. Following the processing, the crude oil is transported to distant consumer refineries through a diameter continuously heated and insulated pipeline. The MPT integrated production facilities support FDP approved production of of oil per day. The Mangala Development Pipeline: The Mangala Development Pipeline (MDP)starts crude oil supplies through pipeline is the world's longest continuously heated and insulated pipeline and will have access to 75% of India's refining capacity. The MDP originates from Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT) in the Mangala Field and passes through two states (Rajasthan and Gujarat), eight districts and travels up to ~670 km before it reaches its end at the coastal location of Bhogat near Jamnagar on the western coast line of India. About 154 km of the pipeline is in Rajasthan and the rest in Gujarat. The MDP is a crude oil pipeline which is using Skin Effect Heat Management System (SEHMS) to ensure that the crude oil remains above the Wax Appearance Temperature (WAT) of 65 Deg C, through the pipeline. It has gas line which feeds gas to all the ~36 Above Ground Installations located at every ~ 18 km distance along the pipeline which produces the necessary power to keep the pipeline at the required temperature. The gas needed to fire the boilers and, more importantly, to generate the power to heat the waxy crude at an average of 65-degree Celsius along the pipeline, comes from the Raageshwari gas field, located 90 km away from the MPT. In addition, there is an intermediate terminal at Viramgam for storage and further pumping to the coast, including a pigging facility. There are two other pigging stations at Sanchore and Wankaner to insert 'pigs' (pipeline cleaning devices) that are used to clean and inspect the pipeline. The pipeline crosses all major crude oil carrier pipelines in the Western part of India and thus, offers potential of blending the Rajasthan crude with these large crude carrier lines. As it terminates at coastal location, the marine facilities are designed to load the crude oil carriers to transport the crude oil to other coastal refiners as well. The pipeline also incorporates the first of its kind Pipeline Intrusion Detection System. This provides security along the entire length, utilising a fibre optic electronic vibration system that generates an alarm. This is linked to a central control unit via a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based mapping system. The entire length of the pipeline is monitored at the MPT, Viramgam and Bhogat terminals for flow, temperature, pressure, and other operational parameters. Phase 1 of the pipeline construction from MPT to Salaya, in Gujarat, includes spur lines to connect to private refiners and another spur line at Radhanpur to connect with the Indian Oil Corporation Limited's (IOCL's) Mundra to Panipat crude pipeline. Since then, oil was introduced in the pipeline on 13 May 2010 and has begun commercial sales to IOCL and private refiners. The pipeline construction from Barmer to Salaya was completed in a record time of 18 months. Phase II: From Salaya to the Bhogat terminal on the Arabian Sea coast, and a pipeline connecting the terminal to the marine facilities is under construction =International operations: Sri Lanka= The Block SL 2007-01-001 was awarded to Cairn Lanka Private Limited, the wholly owned subsidiary of Cairn India. Cairn Lanka commenced its 3D seismic survey in the Mannar Basin in Sri Lanka on 10 December 2009 and the data is currently being processed. The acquisition programme, which was launched by the Honourable President of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa, fulfilled the commitment of 1450 km2 of 3D seismic data acquisition. The Mannar basin is an under- explored frontier basin, with both structural and stratigraphic plays. The drillship 'Chikyu' was mobilised and three well exploration drilling campaign in the SL 2007-01-001 block commenced in August 2011. Cairn Lanka's drilling programmeDoes Sri Lanka have petroleum? Cairn to answer in first quarter 2012 is the first successful programme in Sri Lanka in 30 years and has established a working petroleum system in the frontier Mannar Basin.First gas deposits found off Sri Lanka coastCairn to start Sri Lanka oil exploration 2nd phase The drilling of the phase-II exploration well has been completed in February, 2013. The well encountered high quality reservoir sands; however these sands were water bearing. The well was plugged and abandoned and the rig was demobilized. The results of the well are being integrated with reprocessed 3D seismic data to finalize the forward programme which includes the options for appraisal of the existing two discoveries and entering exploration phase-III. =South Africa= Cairn India has acquired an exploration block in South Africa ('Block 1') and has signed a farm-in agreement with PetroSA, the South African National Oil Company, Block 1 covers a large area of 19,922 km2 and is currently in the initial stages of exploration. It has an existing gas discovery and identified oil & gas leads and prospects. Located in the geologically proven Orange Basin along the northwestern maritime border of South Africa with Namibia, the block is on trend with the discovered Kudu and Ibhubesi gas fields. Cairn India will hold a 60% interest in the block and will be the Operator, while PetroSA will hold the remaining interest. Government approval has been received for transfer and assignment of PetroSA's Participating Interest (PI) to Cairn in Block 1. The assignment agreement was executed in February, 2013. The 3D survey acquisition commenced in March, 2013 and is likely to be completed within this quarter. As on date more than 80% of the survey has been completed. kl; Sponsorships Cairn India has Co- sponsored the Indian Hockey senior teams for a tenure of three years.

The ostentatious gift was met with great happiness as is recounted in a contemporary Spanish recording from the day which refers to the Queen, Elisabeth of France's surprise. The following day, he delivered the present to Mari Louise, an occasion that brought about banquets and parties throughout Paris. In 1686, following the death of his mother, he became the 9th Duke of the Infantado. This officially united all of the family titles held under one name. In 1688, he was named Sumiller de Corps of Charles II of Spain, who in 1693, just before his death, named Gregorio as a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece where after he took a leading role in the royal court.CHEVALIERS DE LA TOISON D'OR He was also an art enthusiast, especially favoring the painter Juan Carreño de Miranda who painted the picture of Queen Marie Louise.

The title is play on Little Johnny Jones. This is also comparable to the 1952 short, One Cab's Family. The short was also nominated for the Academy Awards for best animated short but lost to the Tom and Jerry short Johann Mouse. Synopsis The cartoon follows the story of a B-29 Bomber named John (voiced by Daws Butler), who is married to a Douglas DC-3 named Mary (voiced by June Foray). John can't seem to find work at any airport because they're looking for jets. Mary later reveals that she's going to have a baby, and needing to find work to support his family, Johnny heads off to reenlist in the Air Force, but finds even they won't take him back in, as they're looking for jets as well, which further angers him. When Junior finally arrives, John is happy to be a father and have a child...until it turns out that Junior is a jet as well, which makes John lose his mind (but he doesn't take it out on Junior). When reading the paper the next day, the Hot Air News, John sees the ad for a jet contest held by the United States Government where the winner gets a huge contract. Plenty fed up with jets, he goes to enter the contest as well to try to show them up. Realizing that risk that her husband is putting himself, Mary (with Junior in tow) goes after John. En route to the contest, John meets a B-29 general who smokes Douglas MacArthur's trademark corncob pipe and has Bataan written amidst his five stars. When John asks him, the general declines to enter the contest and states, parodying MacArthur's farewell address to the U.S. Congress, that \\"older planes never fly, they just fade away,\\" before literally fading away. At the contest, John lines up at the starting line with the rest of the jets. Mary and Junior catch up to him and Mary tries convincing John not to go through with the race, but John refuses to listen to her. While this was happening, Junior gets out of the baby buggy and gets in the fuselage of John, and by the time Mary realizes that her son's there, it's too late. At the green flag, the jets all but disappear while John, in comparison, sputters badly to take off and run the race. Within no time, his engines have had enough and detach from his body and fly away on their own, sending him into a nose dive for Earth. Junior realizes what's happening and after a brief struggle with the door, manages to get out of him in time to grab him by the tail and save him. When John notices that he hasn't crashed, he looks back and sees his son holding his tail and flying him along. After happily praising him for saving him, they then kick it into high gear and run the race, tearing past the other contestants (freaking them out in the process), and are shown flying around the world, going by certain landmarks with funny things happening (the Eiffel Tower pulling itself open to let them through, the Leaning Tower of Pisa tilting the other way, they fly by a huge cloud of smog which is completely removed to reveal Los Angeles, The Statue of Liberty's dress blows open to reveal then-rather risqué lingerie on her (leaving Junior perplexed), etc.), and a few non-landmark things as well (a blimp gets cut in half to look like a watermelon, a sky-written ad for a cola changes to read \\"BURP!\\", an ocean liner gets shrunk down to a tugboat, and a rainbow literally tied up like a bow, etc.). They easily win the race and the government contract...for Junior. While John's happy for his son, his joy is soon (somewhat) crushed when the government tells him that they need ten-thousand more just like him—John realizes that he and Mary have some serious procreating to do.

Life Brooks was born in Hatford, near Wantage, Berkshire, in 1825. He was educated at John Roysse's Free School in Abingdon-on-Thames (now Abingdon School) which he attended from about 1835 until 1840. In 1847 he was articled to the London architect Lewis Stride. He attended Thomas Leverton Donaldson's lectures at University College, London, and enrolled as a student at the Royal, Academy Schools. He set up in practice in about 1852, He was architect to the Diocesan Society of Canterbury, and a consulting architect to the Incorporated Society for Building Churches. He became a fellow of the Royal Society of British Architects in 1866, and was its vice-president from 1892-96\\\\. He received its Royal Gold Medal in 1895. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1853 and 1899; from 1894 as \\"James Brooks and Sons\\". His address is given in the Academy catalogues as 6 Bloomsbury Street between 1853 and 1862; 11, Serle Street, Lincoln's Inn, between 1871 and 1875, and 35 Wellington Street, Strand from 1876. He lived, however, for much of this time at The Grange, Park-lane, in Stoke Newington (now numbered 42, Clissold Crescent), a red-brick house built to his own design in 1862. It was at this residence that he died on 7 October 1901 aged 76. Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo was his pupil East London churches St Columba's, church, Haggerston Brooks attracted attention early in his career for several large brick-built churches in East London: St. Michael and All Angels, Shoreditch, St Saviour, Hoxton, St. Columba, Haggerston and St. Chad, Haggerston The last two churches were built as part of the Haggerston Church scheme, which had been set up in 1860, on the initiative of the vicar of St Mary's, the parish church. St Mary's had been designed John Nash in the Gothic style of his time. The first initiative of the scheme was create a chancel and sanctuary of the kind held to be suitable for modern high church ideas of religious ritual. Brooks was brought in to do the work and, according to T. Francis Bumpus, \\"the boldness with which he grappled with such a monster as Nash's structure won him much praise. It was one of his earliest works, and its cleverness and originality brought him into public notice.\\" Money was then raised for new churches, and four new parishes were created in Haggerston, and provided with temporary buildings three of which were soon superseded by permanent buildings, dedicated to three British missionary saints: Augustine, Chad and Columba, and completed by the summer of 1869. Brooks designed the last two. The East London churches were intended for mission work in poor, crowded areas, and built on restricted budgets.Eastlake 1872, p.363 The Church Builder said of them > They are spacious in plan, affording ample accommodation for the estimated > congregations, and an almost lavish supply of room besides in unseated > aisles and transepts. They are all also of unusual height. Their effect is > obtained partly by this spaciousness and height, partly by the fine > proportions of all the parts, partly by a bold, severe dignity in the style > of design.Quoted in They were characterised by their broad naves with narrow aisles; transepts which projected hardly, if at all beyond the aisle walls, and brick vaulted chancels with north and south aisles. The exteriors were plain and unbuttressed, in red brick with stone sparingly used for window dressings and plate tracery, and for occasional bands of relief. Another East London church, St Andrew, Plaistow, was similar in conception, but faced in stone. Brooks tended to use stilted arches, and employed a distinctive type of lierne vault in his chancel, in which the vaults themselves were brick and the ribs stone. Secular architecture Once he had established his reputation as an ecclesiastical architect he built few secular works. An exception was the South Eastern Hotel at Deal in Kent (1894), an asymmetric Renaissance Dutch- style building, in red brick with stone dressings.

Generazio, who drew artwork for and designed the book, said the poems \\"deal with self- identification in an otherwise anonymous society\\". In October 2011, Generazio said his next book would also be a work of poetry, titled Rocky. Instead, Generazio released a travel narrative, The Maniac in the Coffee Shop, on May 17, 2012. The e-book, published in the Amazon Kindle format, covers his travels around the world as a high school and college student. A third book, planned for publication in late 2013 or early 2014, under the working title I'm a Weird Guy, Now: Christian Lezzil's Guide to Stripping will cover Generazio's experiences as an exotic dancer.\\"Christian Lezzil: Winner\\" Metro Weekly. December 12, 2013. Accessed 2013-12-12. Generazio says that there is \\"a lot of poetry\\" in exotic dancing and the alternative lifestyle scene, and he found his experiences generated so much material that the \\"book kind of wrote itself.\\" Rocky was re-titled Slowly, in your Sweetest Hour and released in November 2014. Black Clover When he was in middle school, Generazio participated in a Metallica tribute band. This band dissolved in 2004, and Generazio, a former bandmate, and new band member Sam Haywood created an experimental rock band they named Black Clover. Generazio played drums and sang for the band. Black Clover played a series of dates in the Hampton Roads, Virginia, area and went through several membership changes. Their multimedia shows included projected images and sound effects produced on pieces of metal or with children's toys. Their stage performances also consisted of puppet shows, robots, and balloon art.\\"Black Clover: Proof that what doesn't kill you, truly makes you stronger\\" fourculture November 26, 2013. Accessed 2013-12-12. A live album, An Observation by Black Clover, was followed by a studio album, The Happy Friends EP. Additional membership changes occurred, during which Corey Bartos joined the band. A series of songs, collectively known as \\"The Muppet Sessions\\", were written, and the band toured regionally. Black Clover went on hiatus, reuniting occasionally to write new songs and working sporadically with other artists. The band released a third album, Bucket O' Money! The Essential Black Clover, on May 5, 2012, on Flying Robert Records. In December 2013, Black Clover reunited to release a new album entitled We Used to Have a Band. The various members of Black Clover were interviewed by \\"fourculture,\\" a website and magazine dedicated to music, literature, and the arts. Aaron Wallace (fourculture) writes: \\"The band certainly doesn’t shy away from their sordid histories. In fact, they celebrate them and include them in the tracks as inspiration for their music.\\" In 2016, Black Clover reunited with bassist, Nik Warman, and recorded an album entitled Pornocopia, released on September 27, 2016. While working with Black Clover, Generazio also contributed to a street punk band, The Vons, and a glam metal band, Bigfoot. Exotic dancing Generazio as \\"Christian Lezzil\\" at Gay Pride in Washington D.C. in 2013 After graduating from Virginia Wesleyan in 2011, Generazio spent six months researching The Maniac in the Coffee Shop, and taking modeling and acting classes. He signed with a modeling agency, and began working as a photographer's model.\\"Hottest Stripper or Gogo Dancer: Christian Lezzil.\\" Best of Gay D.C. 2013: Nightlife. Washington Blade. October 24, 2013. Accessed 2013-10-27. He then enrolled in a master's degree program at George Mason University.\\"Woody Norvell.\\" Beautiful Mag. #144 (2013). Accessed 2013-09-25. His anticipated graduation is the spring of 2014. In the fall of 2012, Generazio began exotic dancing under the stage name Christian Lezzil while waiting for his application to graduate school to be accepted. His first performance was at a \\"hot student body\\" competition in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He was looking for experience in an alternative lifestyle, and an all-male revue met that requirement. A friend who performed as a drag queen suggested that he then seek work in Washington, D.C., as a full-time exotic dancer. Shortly after he adopted a drag daughter “Rumor Millz Lezzil” who later became just “Rumor Millz” and seemingly no longer has any affiliation with the dancer. Generazio said he started dancing as a lark, but the work generated enough income to pay for his graduate education. He works primarily at Ziegfeld's in Washington, D.C., although he has made special appearances in cities such as New York City and Charlotte, North Carolina.\\"Weekend Agenda: September 27–30.\\" VisitGayCharlotte.com. September 27, 2012. Accessed 2013-10-03. Generazio says he greatly enjoys exotic dancing. \\"Maybe I'm just a jerk and I'm inflating it, but I think of it as a kind of performance art.\\" He also finds the juxtaposition of being an academic and stripper enjoyably ironic (although he emphasizes that many fellow dancers are similarly situated). In July 2013, Generazio appeared under his \\"Christian Lezzil\\" pseudonym in Beautiful Mag, photographed by Woody Norvell. In October 2013, members of the public in the D.C. metropolitan area voted him D.C.'s \\"Hottest Stripper or GoGo Dancer\\" in the Washington Blade \\"Best of Gay D.C.\\" The following year, he was voted runner up against Adult Entertainment mogul, Steven Pena.\\"Hottest Stripper or Gogo Dancer: Steve Pena.\\" Best of Gay D.C. 2014: People.

Guggenheim Museum collection from Lichtenstein's estate. It depicts a head-on representation of an angry dog growling with the onomatopoeic expression \\"Grrrrrrrrrrr!!\\". The work was derived from Our Fighting Forces, which also served as the source for other military dog paintwork by Lichtenstein. Background alt=a comic frame with military men and a dog The Lichtenstein foundation notes that the inspiration for this painting is a frame of Our Fighting Forces #66 (February 1962), which was published by National Periodical Publications (now DC Comics). In that frame only a portion of the dog's head is visible and the speech balloon says \\"Grrrrr!\\" In addition to the painting itself, Lichtenstein produced a small graphite on paper study. The painting was bestowed to the Guggenheim Museum after Lichtenstein's 1997 death, following a promise made in 1992. The museum used Grrrrrrrrrrr!! in the promotional posters for the 1993 exhibition \\"Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective\\", which ran from October 7, 1993 – January 16, 1994. Other notable exhibitions where this work was shown include \\"Rendezvous: Masterpieces from the Centre Georges Pompidou and the Guggenheim Museums\\" which ran from October 16, 1998 – January 24, 1999 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, as well as \\"Art in America: 300 Years of Innovation\\" which traveled to several museums in China between 2007 and 2008. The work appeared on the cover of the November 1993 issue of ARTnews. Details Although Grrrrrrrrrrr!! is derived from what Guggenheim Senior Curator Susan Davidson calls a \\"low-grade comic strip\\" that is a typical Lichtenstein source, it is representative of Lichtenstein's fascination with \\"the atomic language of Ben- Day dots, black outlines and the three primary colors as the elementary vocabulary of low-budget commercial imagery.\\" According to Jennifer Blessing of the Guggenheim, \\"There is also an element of humor in creating fine art out of what has customarily been considered 'low,' a playfulness that is equally evident in the onomatopoeic caption and bellicose expression of the dog in Grrrrrrrrrrr!!\\" Related works In 1962, Lichtenstein created Arrrrrff!, an oil and graphite pencil on canvas painting depicting a dog from a subsequent issue of Our Fighting Forces, the series that was the source of Grrrrrrrrrrr!! That source depicts the dog by the name of \\"Pooch\\" in profile with a text bubble reading \\"Sniff--Sniff--Sniff--Sniff--Arrrrrff!\\" above his head. The inspiration for this painting came from Our Fighting Forces #69 (July 1962). Arrrrrff! was sold at Christie's in 1996 for $420,500 to an undisclosed buyer.

It is an oil on canvas Pop art work that is now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, after being owned for several decades by Philip Johnson. It is one of Lichtenstein's earliest Pop art works and is known for its source, which is a newspaper ad that ran for several decades and which was among Lichtenstein's earliest works sourced from pop culture. Girl with Ball was exhibited at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition and was displayed in Newsweek review of the show. This work significantly alters the original source and is considered exemplary of Lichtenstein's works that exaggerate the mechanically produced appearance although the result of his painterly work. It is an enduring depiction of the contemporary beauty figure. Background The source of Girl with Ball was a common advertisement image. Girl with Ball was inspired by a 1961 advertisement for the Mount Airy Lodge in the Pocono Mountains. The ad, which started running in 1955, was widely published in the New York metropolitan area and elsewhere, including several prominent newspapers such as The New York Times and the Daily News. The advertisement was still running in newspapers more than twenty years after Lichtenstein produced the work. According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, in autumn 1961, a fellow teacher at Rutgers University named Allan Kaprow made introductions between Lichtenstein and Leo Castelli Gallery director Ivan Karp. Lichtenstein showed Karp several paintings including Girl with Ball, which was the one that intrigued Karp. Karp agreed to represent Lichtenstein weeks later. After showing the painting to Andy Warhol, he sold it to architect Philip Johnson that November. The painting appeared in Newsweek 1962 review of Lichtenstein's Castelli Gallery show. The work appeared in the April 3, 1963 \\"Pop! Goes the Easel\\" show at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston along with his Brattata (1962) and Head-Red and Yellow (1962). Description Girl with Ball depicts a woman wearing a bathing suit holding a beach ball with red stripes in the same color as her lips and tongue. Lichtenstein used a painter's version of comic strip artist techniques to create his own rendition of the subject of a nostalgic photograph, resulting in a simplified work of art with its own appeal. He produced the work using Ben-Day dots of primary colors. The process is described as exaggerating the \\"limitations of mechanical reproduction\\" to strip the photograph of its polish in a startling and intense form. In 1961, this painting was groundbreaking. Facial features such as nose and mouth are depicted using \\"commercial shorthand\\". His process of reworking original artwork is described as \\"abstraction by subtraction\\", in which all features of the original are reduced to simple graphic elements.Coplans, p. 176. Lichtenstein alters the planar position of the subject of the picture to position her \\"nearer to the picture plane\\". He drew the picture more distorted than might be expected of a cartoonist by augmenting and focusing on her two- dimensionality. Reception The image and technique were regarded as unartistic. However, the painting presented an allusion to printing technology, with its Ben-Day dots, and to art history, with its \\"Art Nouveau forms\\". Though \\"crude and simplistic\\" the work demonstrates artistic intellect. Girl with Ball is described by Diane Waldman as \\"striking\\" in the simple and bold way it presents a vacation atmosphere. She notes it is \\"reminiscent of Picasso's frolicking bather in one of his paintings on the subject, Bather with Beach Ball (fig. 48), 1932,\\" especially in the way Lichtenstein has scaled down the representation and the way he depicts movement. The newspaper ad source provided Lichtenstein with \\"one of the most common tropes of the day for the image of a woman.\\" The updated Betty Grable- type subject, was a fashionable glamor figure that Lichtenstein used for a symbolic value that ranks her with \\"iconoclastic female figures, including Manet's Olympia, 1863, Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, 1907 and de Kooning's three series of Women\\".

(sometimes Torpedo...LOS!) is a 1963 pop art oil on canvas painting by Roy Lichtenstein. When it was last sold in 1989, The New York Times described the work as \\"a comic-strip image of sea warfare\\". It formerly held the record for the highest auction price for a Lichtenstein work. Its 1989 sale helped finance the construction of the current home of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago in 1991. Like many of Lichtenstein's works its title comes from the speech balloon in the painting. The work was included in Lichtenstein's second solo exhibition. The source of the image is a comic book from DC Comics. Lichtenstein has made significant alterations to the original image to change the focus and perspective in addition to significant alteration of the narrative element of the work. The work plays on the background-foreground relationship and the theme of vision that appears in many of Lichtenstein's works. Background The source of Torpedo...Los! is \\"Battle of the Ghost Ships?\\" (story by Bob Haney, art by Jack Abel) in DC Comics' Our Fighting Forces (October 1962). The source of the image is Jack Abel's art in the Bob Haney-written story \\"Battle of the Ghost Ships?\\", in DC Comics' Our Fighting Forces #71 (October 1962), although the content of the speech balloon is different (this is issue number 72 according to some sources and 71 (a) according to others). Our Fighting Forces #71 at the Grand Comics Database According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, Torpedo...Los! was part of Lichtenstein's second solo exhibition at Leo Castelli Gallery of September 28 – October 24, 1963, that included Drowning Girl, Baseball Manager, In the Car, Conversation, and Whaam! Marketing materials for the show included the lithograph artwork, Crak! On November 7, 1989, Torpedo...Los! sold at Christie's for $5.5 million (US$ million in dollars) to Zurich dealer Thomas Ammann, which was a record for a work of art by Lichtenstein. The sale was described as the \\"highpoint\\" of a night in which Christie's achieved more than double the total sales prices of any other contemporary art auction up to that date. The seller of the work was Beatrice C. Mayer, the widow of Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago founder and board member Robert B. Mayer as well as daughter of Sara Lee Corporation founder Nathan Cummings. Prior to the sale the work was part of the Robert B. Mayer Memorial Loan Program and was exhibited at colleges and museums. Torpedo...Los! was expected to sell for $3 to 4 million at the time. In 1991, Mayer became one of the key benefactors of the new Museum of Contemporary Art Building. Description Measuring , Torpedo...Los! is an oil on canvas painting. By enlarging the face of the captain relative to the entire field, Lichtenstein makes him more prominent than in the source. He retained the source's \\"clumsiness\\" in how the secondary figure is presented and replaced the dialogue with a much shorter \\"cryptic command\\". The original source had dialog related to the repeated torpedoing of the same ship, but Lichtenstein cut the entire speech balloon down to two words. He moved the captain's scar from his nose to his cheek and he made the captain appear more aggressive by depicting him with his mouth wide open, also opting to leave the eye which was not looking through the periscope open. He also made the ship appear to be more technologically sophisticated with a variety of changes. The scar was actually most readily apparent in panels other than the source from the same story. This work exemplifies Lichtenstein's theme relating to vision. Lichtenstein uses a \\"mechanical viewing device\\" to present his depiction of technically aided vision., \\"Like Torpedo...LOS! and CRAK!, each of these works contains the image of a mechanical aid to vision.\\" The depicted mechanical device, a periscope in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format. In some of his works such as this, monocularity is a strong theme that is directly embodied although only by allusion. Michael Lobel notes that \\"...his work proposes a dialectical tension between monocular and binocular modes of vision, a tension that operates on the level of gender as well.\\" The work is regarded as one in which Lichtenstein exaggerated comic book sound effects in common pop art style. Reception This painting exemplifies Lichtenstein's use of the background/foreground shift and ironic colloquialisms in critical commands. Although most of Lichtenstein's war imagery depicts American war themes, this depicts \\"a scarred German submarine captain at a battle station\\". The manner of depiction with the commander's face pressed against the periscope reflects fusions of industrial art of the 1920s and 1930s. The ironic aspect of this in 1963 is in part due to its temporal displacement referring back to World War II during the much later period of the Cold War. The styling of the balloon content, especially that of the large font characters, is complemented by or complementary to the other traditional visual content of the painting. Lichtenstein's alterations heightened the sense of urgency in the image, however, they also offset that menace by forming a detached work. A November 1963 Art Magazine review stated that this was one of the \\"broad and powerful paintings\\" of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery.

This is comparable to the 1953 cartoon, Little Johnny Jet. The title is a play on the radio soap opera program One Man's Family. Synopsis A yellow taxi named John (voiced by Daws Butler), along with his wife Mary (a blue taxi car, voiced by June Foray), awaits the arrival of their new son, who looks just like John. Within his first few months, Junior is fed, changed, learns to \\"walk\\", gets his first \\"tooth\\" (a spark plug), etc. When Mary asks Junior if he's going to grow up to be a taxi cab like his father, Junior declines and turns on the television to show an auto race, implying he wants to grow up being a race car. John is very angered by this and sends Junior to his room, but Junior is still determined to live his dream as a race car. As such, Junior converts himself into a hot rod convertible before zooming around the house in front of John. Enraged by Junior's defiance, John spanks him (by opening his trunk, exposing his bare buttocks) and sends him back to his room, demanding him to go back to his taxi persona. Fed up with his father's refusal to accept his choice, Junior angrily sneaks out the window, fuels up with high octane gas, and goes zooming all around town, spooking everything in his way. Upon seeing Junior escaping, John chases after him, but can't seem to catch him because of the octane gas. However, John gets his second wind when he sees Junior racing alongside a train, playing chicken with it. After another chase, John runs out of gas and ends up being stuck on the railroad track. Upon seeing his father in danger, a horrified Junior goes back to save his father by pushing him away from the track, but ends up run over by the train himself (Vehicle Accident crash with a train), much to John's shock. The injured Junior is then sent to a garage to be fixed. As John weeps over his son's fate and is very grateful for saving his life, a repairman tells John that Junior will survive and asks John to have either the taxi cab or hot rod converted on Junior. Feeling extremely remorseful for pushing Junior away from his dream of being a race car in the first place, John states that Junior is old enough to make that decision himself, implying that he's willing to accept Junior's choice of being either a taxi cab or a hot rod. Eventually, Junior decides to convert back as a taxi cab, much to John's happiness, but it turns out to be a compromising decision, as Junior shows he still has the hot rod motor and exhaust pipes.

Some details about Thomas’s action are recorded by his contemporary Nikandros Noukios, who followed as a non-combatant the English invasion of Scotland in 1545 and the expedition to Boulogne in 1546. A part of Noukios’ manuscript (originally in Greek) was published in English in 1841. A consequent part of the original manuscript, continuing the narration about Thomas, was published by the Greek historian Andreas Moustoxydes.Moustoxydes Andreas (1856), Nikandros Noukios, in the periodical Pandora, vol. 7, No. 154, 15 Augh. 1856, p. 222 In Greek language. Thomas was the head of a unit of stratioti from the Peloponnese and is described as a man of “courage, prudence and experience in wars”. Noukios followed Thomas and the English army to the River Tweed between England and Scotland where the light cavalry of stratioti made incursions against the Scots. Noukios describes a confrontation between Thomas’ unit of about 550 men and a superior group of some 1,000 French during the Siege of Boulogne. He gives a description of the unorthodox tactics, typical of the stratioti light cavalry, against an numerically superior unit of heavy armoured cavalry. Before the battle Thomas boosted the courage of his men with this short speech: The stratioti ambushed the French coming from Boulogne in early dawn and with maneuvers caused them to retreat in disarray. The battle was carried out mainly with lances and swords leaving 35 Greeks and 360 French dead. Thomas was wounded during that battle. Henry VIII praised his bravery and granted him an annual salary. After the Boulogne expedition Thomas returned to England and Noukios departed to Italy. Noukios mentions no other name for Thomas of Argos. However, some secondary sources assume that he is the same person as a Thomas Bouas (or Buas) who was arrested by the French and executed in Turin in 1546.Pappas Nicholas C. J.

Widely regarded as the bridge between his abstract expressionism and pop art works, it is notable for its ironic humor and aesthetic value as well as being the first example of the artist's employment of Ben-Day dots, speech balloons and comic imagery as a source for a painting. The painting was bequeathed to the Washington, D.C., National Gallery of Art upon Lichtenstein's death. Building on his late 1950s drawings of comic strips characters, Look Mickey marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of painterly techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations of pop culture and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery. In this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing to the work of artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck during a fishing mishap. However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color scheme and perspective, while seeming to make statements about himself. The work dates from Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition, and is regarded by art critics as revolutionary both as a progression of pop art and as a work of modern art in general. It was later reproduced in his 1973 painting, Artist's Studio—Look Mickey, which shows the painting hanging prominently on a facing wall of Lichtenstein's studio. Background During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips into their work. Lichtenstein was among them, and in 1958 began to make drawings of comic strip characters. Andy Warhol produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced Look Mickey and Popeye in 1961. Lichtenstein's 1961 works, especially Look Mickey, are considered a minor step from his earlier comic strip pop art. Lichtenstein used this image from Donald Duck Lost and Found (illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten) for Look Mickey. According to the Lichtenstein Foundation, Look Mickey was based on the Little Golden Book series. The National Gallery of Art notes that the source is entitled Donald Duck Lost and Found, written in 1960 by Carl Buettner and published through Disney Enterprises. The image was illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten. An alternative theory suggests that Look Mickey and Popeye were enlargements of bubble gum wrappers. This image marked the first of numerous works in which Lichtenstein cropped his source to bring the viewer closer to the scene. A number of stories purport to tell of the moment of inspiration for Look Mickey. Critic Alice Goldfarb Marquis writes that the artist recalled one of his sons pointing to a comic book and challenging; \\"I bet you can't paint as good as that\\". Another says that the painting resulted from an effort to prove his abilities to both his son and his son's classmates who mocked Lichtenstein's hard-to-fathom abstracts. American painter Allan Kaprow once stated, in reference to a Bazooka Dubble Bubble Gum wrapper, to Lichtenstein, \\"You can't teach color from Cézanne, you can only teach it from something like this.\\" Lichtenstein then showed him one of his Donald Duck images. During the comic book phase of his career, Lichtenstein often slightly altered the colorization of the original source. According to Marco Livingstone, his early comic subjects comprise a \\"loose and improvised style clearly derived from de Kooning.\\" Art historian Jonathan Fineberg describes a Lichtenstein painting of 1960 as an \\"...abstract expressionist picture with Mickey Mouse in it, related stylistically to the de Kooning Women\\". When Leo Castelli saw both Lichtenstein's and Warhol's large comic strip-based works, he elected to show only Lichtenstein's, causing Warhol to create the Campbell's Soup Cans series to avoid competing with the more refined style of comics Lichtenstein was then producing.Bourdon, p. 109. He once said \\"I've got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing.\\"Watson, p. 79. Lichtenstein's foray into comics led to the abandonment of the topic by Warhol. Although Lichtenstein continued to work with comic sources, after 1961 he avoided the easily identified sources like Popeye and Mickey Mouse. During autumn 1961, Allan Kaprow, a fellow teacher at Rutgers University, introduced Lichenstein to art dealer Ivan Karp, the director of the Leo Castelli Gallery. Lichtenstein showed Karp several paintings, but not Look Mickey. He instead impressed him with Girl with Ball, and Karp decided to represent Lichtenstein a few weeks later. Description The painting is one of Lichtenstein's first non-expressionist works, and marks his initial employment of Ben-Day dots which he used to give it an \\"industrial\\" half-tone effect. The painting is his first use both of a speech balloon and comics as source material. The work has visible pencil marks and was produced using a plastic-bristle dog brush to apply the oil paint onto the canvas. By the time of his death, Look Mickey was regarded as Lichtenstein's breakthrough work. In reproducing a mass-produced illustration in a painterly style, Lichtenstein simplifies by reducing the composition to primary colors, which serves to accentuate its mass appeal and largely gives it the \\"pop\\" look. Typically, Ben-Day dots enable an artist to produce a variety of colors by using dots of a few colors to give the illusion of a broader palette. By mixing dots of different colors, like an ink jet printer, just a few colors can create a broad spectrum using only a limited number of primary hues. Lichtenstein as a painter and not a mass production printer is able to avoid this, achieving his individual color tones without blending existing hues. Instead, for each color that he wanted to include in a work, he used that color paint. Lichtenstein made several alterations to the original work: he eliminated various figures and rotated the dock so that Donald looks off the side rather than the end. At the same time, he kept Donald and Mickey in almost the same positions as they were in the original. Lichtenstein not only redesigned the space, but also altered the position of Donald's body and fishing rod and eliminated signs of stress and exertion. He also adds a speech balloon, making Donald seem unaware that he has failed to cast his rod. Walt Disney said about Donald Duck: \\"He's got a big mouth, a big belligerent eye, a twistable neck and a substantial backside that's highly flexible. The duck comes near being the animator's ideal subject.\\" Lichtenstein's painting reflects many of these physical features. Compared to the original source, Donald leans further forward towards the water, and Mickey less so. Mickey's face is more flushed. The composition incorporates some of the foibles of comic book printing, including misalignment of the contours of the waves with the yellow sky to give rise to an area of white space. Interpretation The large scale reproduction of a comic strip frame was considered radical and revolutionary at the time. Critics applauded the work's playfulness, inherent humor and irreverence. According to Diane Waldman of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, \\"Look Mickey is broad comedy and falls into the category of slapstick ...\\" In Lichtenstein's obituary, Los Angeles Times critic Christopher Knight described the work as \\"a slyly hilarious riff on Abstract Expressionism\\". Lichtenstein's slight alterations to its \\"linear clarity and colour\\", the critic writes, add to its aesthetic value and grandeur, reinforced by his choice of scale. A common misconception about Lichtenstein comes from the fact that in his best known works, his meticulous approach to painting is purposely disguised because he superficially seeks his paintings to appear as if facsimiles of industrial produced pop culture icons. Graham Bader wrote that \\"Lichtenstein's painting in fact appears more the product of industrial manufacture than the very pulp image on which it is based.\\" Look Mickey is considered self-referential in the sense that the artist is painting something through which the viewer may see elements of the artist. Look Mickey has reflective elements that call upon Caravaggio's Narcissus. Bader observes that Look Mickey is concerned both with the artistic process and Lichtenstein's new painting techniques. He believes it can be considered a self-portrait in the sense that it \\"explicitly situates the painting's maker himself within the self-enclosed narcissistic circuit at its center\\". The painting shows Donald looking into the reflective water at Lichtenstein's blue 'rfl' signature \\"as a kind of surrogate for the image's creator\\", in a manner that is reminiscent of Caravaggio's Narcissus, in which the subject gazes at his own reflection on the water. This is viewed as an allegory of Lichtenstein's position as an artist trained to develop his realist instincts despite the prominence of abstract expressionism. When viewed this way, Mickey serves as the \\"vanguard modernist\\" superego towering over Lichtenstein and laughing at his retrograde efforts. Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots to color Mickey's face. According to some art critics, this gives the character the appearance of blushing. Other interpretations are that the coloration is merely skin pigmentation or that it is the hue associated with a \\"healthy glow,\\" since Mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather than fur. Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he can have it for lunch – is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority. Those adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness of the red dots, but others are quick to point out that Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage. He did not develop the use of a stencil (i.e. the technique of pressing the liquid paint onto the surface through a screen of dots) to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963. Graham Bader, describing it as the engine of the painting's narrative, notes the intrigue created by the juxtaposition of Donald's heightened sense of visual perception as it relates to his anticipated catch, and his deadened sense of tactile perception as it relates to having a fishing hook in the back of his own shirt. In this sense, Lichtenstein has chosen to depict a source that has as its subject a divide between raised visual awareness and an absent sense of touch: Lichtenstein frequently explored vision-related themes after he began to work in the pop art genre; early examples include I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (I Can See the Whole Room ... and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements. Legacy Artist's Studio—Look Mickey The painting was included in Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition at The Leo Castelli Gallery, a show in which all the works had pre-sold before its opening in February 1962. The exhibition, which ran from February 10 through March 3, 1962, included Engagement Ring, Blam and The Refrigerator. He included the painting in his Artist's Studio—Look Mickey (1973), showing it hanging prominently on the wall of the pictorial space intended to depict his studio as the ideal studio, and implying that his popularity with critic and public ratifies his choice of popular culture subject matter. Reflecting on Look Mickey many years later, he said: The painting was bequeathed to the Washington National Gallery of Art after Lichtenstein's death in 1997, following a 1990 pledge in honor of the institution's 50th Anniversary. It remains in the gallery's collection, where, , it is on permanent view. Harold Rosenberg once described Lichtensteins reworking of the comics source as follows: \\"...the difference between a comic strip of Mickey Mouse and a Lichtenstein painting of the same was art history, or the fact that Lichtenstein paints with the idea of the museum in mind.\\" See also * 1961 in art Notes References   * External links *National Gallery of Art Collection website *Lichtenstein Foundation website Category:1961 paintings Category:Collections of the National Gallery of Art Category:Donald Duck Category:Birds in art Category:Mickey Mouse in art Category:Paintings by Roy Lichtenstein Category:Water in art ","title":"Look Mickey"},{"id":"35764441","text":"Phragmataecia monika is a species of moth of the family Cossidae.

The fuzzy linker region (shown by dotted line) of the Ultrabithorax transcription factor (orange) connects the homedomain with the Extradenticle homedomain (blue) (PDB code 1bi). Alternative splicing modulates the length of the fuzzy region and thus its DNA (grey) binding affinity. Other regulatory fuzzy regions of Ultrabithorax are also shown by dotted lines. Fuzzy complexes are protein complexes, where structural ambiguity or multiplicity exists and is required for biological function.Fuxreiter, M. & Tompa, P. (2011) Fuzziness: Structural Disorder in Protein Complexes Austin, New York. Alteration, truncation or removal of conformationally ambiguous regions impacts the activity of the corresponding complex. Fuzzy complexes are generally formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. Structural multiplicity usually underlies functional multiplicity of protein complexes following a fuzzy logic. Distinct binding modes of the nucleosome are also regarded as a special case of fuzziness.  Historical background  For almost 50 years molecular biology was based on two dogmas: (i) equating biological function of the protein with a unique three-dimensional structure and (ii) assuming exquisite specificity in protein complexes. Specificity/selectivity is ensured by unambiguous set of interactions formed between the protein and its ligand (another protein, DNA, RNA or small molecule). Many protein complexes however, contain functionally important/critical regions, which remain highly dynamic in the complex or adopt different conformations. This phenomenon is defined fuzziness. The most pertinent example is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1, which binds to the SCF subunit of Cdc4 in a phosphorylation dependent manner. No regular secondary structures are gained upon phosphorylation and the different phosphorylation sites interchange in the complex.  Classification of fuzzy complexes  Structural ambiguity in protein complexes covers a wide spectrum. In a polymorphic complex, the protein adopts two or more different conformations upon binding to the same partner, and these conformations can be resolved. Clamp, flanking and random complexes are dynamic, where ambiguous conformations interchange with each other and cannot be resolved. Interactions in fuzzy complexes are usually mediated by short motifs. Flanking regions are tolerant to sequence changes as long as the amino acid composition is maintained, for example in case of linker histone C-terminal domains and H4 histone N-terminal domains.  Regulatory pathways via fuzzy regions  Fuzzy regions modulate the conformational equilibrium or flexibility of the binding interface via transient interactions. Dynamic regions can also compete with binding sites or tether them to the target. Modifications of fuzzy regions by further interactions, or posttranslational modifications impact binding affinity or specificity. Alternative splicing can modulate the length of fuzzy regions resulting in context-dependent binding (e.g. tissue- specificity) on the complex. EGF/MAPK, TGF-β and WNT/Wingless signaling pathways employ tissue-specific fuzzy regions.

Biography  = Education and early career = Son of Évrard Bourlon de Rouvre, an industrialist, and his wife Claude Genty, Cyril Bourlon de Rouvre is the heir of sugar refineries and the landed property of his great-grandfather, Charles Bourlon de Rouvre (1850–1924), himself stepson of one of the richest men at the end of the 19th century, Gustave Lebaudy. After studies at the collège Maspero in Paris, then at the collège Saint-Martin de France in Pontoise, the Oratory School in Reading, the Collège Saint-Jean in Fribourg and at the Lycée Janson-de- Sailly,PEOPLE: CYRIL BOURLON DE ROUVRE Cyril Bourlon de Rouvre studied electrical engineering at Jussieu before graduating as an aerospace engineer at the Institut polytechnique des sciences avancées. He first worked at Électricité de France before serving his conscription and started his career as a sales engineer at the Elliot Automation company (1966–1968) before being Director of export of the Sucre Union company (1971–1973). He was business manager of the sales support department of the Lara audiovisual company (1973), then commercial agent in the audiovisual (1974–1975) and associate director at the Auto Racing company (1977). = A young and dynamic business leader = In 1979, upon the death of his father (who was murdered by his valet), he inherited large real estate holdings, a sugar refinery and 28 companies. He became CEO of Financière Robur et de Cofragec (1982–1992), La drôle de faillite de Cyril de Rouvre, ancien patron de Ligier Coficine (1984–1992) and many other companies. He modernized the sugar factory and his inheritance prospered, taking, in 1981, control of the holding Fraissinet, owner of the business airline Transair. In 1987, he started a new career in film distribution by acquiring, from the producer Robert Dorfmann, Les millions de Cyril by one of its companies, the Financière Robur, Cofragec company with its catalog of 650 films including La Grande Vadrouille or La Vache et le Prisonnier. He produced movies including La Nuit bengali (1988) of Nicolas Klotz, Les Deux Fragonard (1989) of Philippe Le Guay, and La Peste (1992) of Luis Puenzo. He also invested in real estate, including a hotel in Tahiti. Passionate about cars and racing, he rallied with Thierry Sabine, including Abidjan-Nice driving a Range Rover. = Political life in Haute- Marne and investment in Formula 1 = In 1989, he started a political career in Haute-Marne, a department where which his grandfather Charles de Rouvre was a deputy during the Third Republic. He was elected mayor of Chaumont, as an independent (classified as miscellaneous right) against the centrist senator and mayor Georges Berchet, and regional councilor for the Champagne-Ardenne region (1992–1998). He takes his team, as an alderman, a man of 25 years, Luc Chatel, becoming in fact the first \\" political godfather \\". Owner of the Formula 1 team AGS from March 1989 to 1991, he swallowed $18 million and began selling activities of his group, about 70 companies: First Transair, then the sugar factory, sold to the Compagnie de Navigation Mixte, and in 1992, the catalog of movies, lent to UGC in the form of a merger. In 1991, he gives AGS the Italians Gabriele Rafanelli and Patrizio Cantu. In 1992, Cyril de Rouvre bought the Formula 1 team Ligier for an estimated price of 200 million of francs. With its new owner, the team started to again be competitive – the 1993 season was a success, with a 5th place in the constructor's championship (the team's best result since 1986). But the involvement of Cyril de Rouvre lasted only one season because of legal troubles. = The legal troubles and the decline = The 14 December 1993, the judge Eva JolyCyril de Rouvre incarcerated him at the Fleury-Mérogis Prison, as part of a complaint for fraud filed by the leaders of UGC, Guy Verrecchia and Alain Sussfeld, following the takeover in June 1992 the company Cofragec. This company has been emptied of its assets, leaving a liability estimated at 172.6 million francs. Cyril de Rouvre had promised to repay this sum at the end of 1992 but at that time, he still had 100 million. On 5 May 1993, leaders of UGC have filed a complaint against him. He spent two months in prison. In early 1994, he sold Ligier to Flavio Briatore. He lost the mayoralty of Chaumont at the French municipal elections of 1995. In 1996, a judicial investigation was opened against him at the Tribunal de grande instance of Chaumont. He appeared before the Criminal Court of this city in September 1999 for tax evasion. Knowing that the prosecution had requested a sentence of three years imprisonment and a 20-year ban on company management, he was sentenced on 19 December 1999, his birthday, to a suspended sentence of 18 months imprisonment' a ban from managing a company for 3 years, and a large fine.

Breve storia della Cascina Torchiera It is located in zone 8 of Milan, adjacent to the Maggiore cemetery, in the Musocco/Garegnano district, Alberto di Monte, Torchiera e Merlata: due cascine milanesi nell'Expo della postmodernità , pp. 27-39 and is one of the oldest surviving cascine within the city boundaries. The cascina is formally the property of the Comune di Milano city administration and has been a squatted self-managed social centre since the 1992. It is known as Cascina Autogestita Torchiera SenzAcqua. History The cascina has undergone several transformations over the centuries. The original building dates back to the 14th century; at the time, it was located in the middle of a large rural area. The name \\"torchiera\\" may be a reference to an olive press (\\"torchio\\" in Italian) or the manufacturing of hemp rope (\\"torcitura\\"). The Mailänder Kataster (an 18th-century cadastre of Milan), reports cultivations of barley and mulberry in the land that surrounded the cascina. Historically a property of the clergy of the nearby Garegnano Charterhouse, the cascina and the surrounding land (including the Maggiore cemetery) were ceded to the Comune di Milano in 1888. Part of the building was demolished to create a large open space at the entrance of the cemetery; as a consequence, the cascina is now L-shaped, having lost the original square-yarded structure that is typical of cascine. After becoming a property of the Comune, the cascina was adapted for diverse uses such as craft workshops, small shops, and a local seat of the Italian Socialist Party; nevertheless, it was never properly maintained and restored. Eventually there was structural subsidence and a large portion of the roof collapsed. Social centre In 1992, the cascina was squatted and turned into an anti-fascist, anti-racist and anti-authoritarian social centre, known as Centro Sociale Autogestito Torchiera. The center remains active in 2020, despite sporadic attempts by Milan's administration to dismantle it or to sell the property. In vendita gli immobili del comune Soon after the occupation, the city administration blocked the water supply, leading the centre to become known as Cascina Autogestita Torchiera SenzAcqua, where \\"SenzAcqua\\" means \\"WithoutWater\\". In 1999, author Dario Fo prevented an eviction by calling the mayor. Volunteers from the social centre have been restoring the building since 1994. Social activities in the cascina include theatre performances, gymnastic workshops, book presentations, musical events and Italian language classes for foreigners. Libertari cazzuola alla mano In the summer of 2020, the city of Milan decided to sell off 25 unused assets, one of which was the social centre. This had also been considered in 2011. In response, the centre organised a public assembly in early September 2020 in support of autonomous spaces in Milan such as itself, Ri-Make, Lambretta and SOS Fornace Rho.

The Prophetiæ Merlini is a Latin work of Geoffrey of Monmouth circulated, perhaps as a libellus or short work, from about 1130, and by 1135. Another name is Libellus Merlini. The work contains a number of prophecies attributed to Merlin, the wizard of legend, whose mythical life is often regarded as created by Geoffrey himself although Geoffrey himself claims to have based on older Brittonic traditions some of which may have been oral but now lost. The Prophetiae preceded Geoffrey's larger Historia Regum Britanniæ of c. 1136, and was mostly incorporated in it, in Book VII; the prophecies, however, were influential and widely circulated in their own right. According to Geoffrey, he was prompted by Alexander of Lincoln to produce this section of his larger work separately. Background The Prophetiæ is in some ways dependent on the De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniæ of Gildas. From Gildas and Nennius Geoffrey took the figure of Ambrosius Aurelianus, who figures in the preface to the prophecies (under a variant name): there is then a confusion made between Ambrosius and Merlin, deliberately done.Libellus Merlini in Lewis Spence, A Dictionary of Medieval Romance and Romance Writers (1913), pp. 222–3; archive.org. When Geoffrey's Historia was largely translated by Wace into the Roman de Brut, he omitted the material on Merlin's prophecies, though he does profess knowledge of them., p. 37 It was still read in Latin, but was displaced for readers in French, and then English, by other political prophecy. This work not only launched Merlin as a character of Arthurian legend: it also created a distinctively English style of political prophecy, called Galfridian, in which animals represent particular political figures.Rupert Taylor, The Political Prophecy in England (1911), pp. 4–5;archive.org. Political prophecy in this style remained popular for at least 400 years. It was subversive, and the figure of the prophetic Merlin was strongly identified with it. Content and the character of Merlin The Prophetiae is the work that introduced the character of Merlin (Merlinus), as he later appears in Arthurian legend. He mixes pagan and Christian elements. In this work Geoffrey drew from the established bardic tradition of prophetic writing attributed to the sage Myrddin, though his knowledge of Myrddin's story at this stage in his career appears to have been slight.Ziolkowski, Jan (1990). \\"The Nature of Prophecy in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Vita Merlini\\", p. 152. In Kugel, James L. (Ed.), Poetry and Prophecy: the Beginnings of a Literary Tradition. Cornell. In the preface Vortigern asks Ambrosius (Merlin) to interpret the meaning of a vision. In it two dragons fought, one red and one white. Merlin replies that the Red Dragon meant the British race, the White Dragon the Saxons. The Saxons would be victorious. A long prophetic sequence forms the body of the work, relating mainly to the wars. Many of its prophecies referring to historical and political events up to Geoffrey's lifetime can be identified – for example, the sinking of the White Ship in 1120, when William Adelin, son of Henry I, died. Geoffrey apparently introduced the spelling \\"Merlin\\", derived from the Welsh \\"\\". The Welsh scholar Rachel Bromwich observed that this \\"change from medial dd > l is curious. It was explained by Gaston Paris as caused by the undesirable associations of the French word merde\\".Bromwich, Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Welsh Triads, second edition [Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978], p. 472 n.1. Alternatively this may preserve the Breton or Cornish original to which he may have been referring; John of Cornwall's (1141–55) version is notable for its localisation in the southwestern region known to Gildas & Nennius as Dumnonia. Influence The first work about the prophet Myrddin in a language other than Welsh, the Prophetiae was widely read — and believed — much as the prophecies of Nostradamus were centuries later; John Jay Parry and Robert Caldwell note that the Prophetiae Merlini \\"were taken most seriously, even by the learned and worldly wise, in many nations\\", and list examples of this credulity as late as 1445.John Jay Parry and Robert Caldwell. \\"Geoffrey of Monmouth\\" in Arthurian Literature in the Middle Ages, Roger S. Loomis (ed.), Clarendon Press, Oxford University, 1959, p. 79 Ordericus Vitalis quoted from the Prophetiae around 1134–5. At much the same time, and in the same area, Abbot Suger copied some of the prophecies almost exactly in his Life of Louis the Fat, for the purpose of praising Henry I of England.Lindy Grant, Abbot Suger of St-Denis: Church and State in Early Twelfth-Century France (1998), p. 39 and p. 42. In the 1140s or early 1150s John of Cornwall produced another work collecting prophecies, that drew on the Prophetiae. It contained elements from other sources, however, which predominate. This work was also named Prophetiae Merlini. Gunnlaugr Leifsson made an Icelandic translation of the prophecies, Merlínússpá. There is a 15th-century English manuscript commentary on Geoffrey's work. In the 16th century the founding legends of British history came under strong criticism, in particular from Polydore Vergil. On the other hand, they had their defenders, and there was a revival of Arthurian lore with a Protestant slant, used in particular by John Dee to develop the concept of the British Empire in the New World. By the 17th century Geoffrey's history in general, and Merlin's prophecies in particular, had become largely discredited as fabrications, for example as attacked by William Perkins.Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic, pp. 507–8. But the politics of the Union of the Crowns of 1603 gave the prophecies a short new lease of life (see Jacobean debate on the Union). The Whole Prophesie of Scotland of that year treated Merlin's prophecies as authoritative. James Maxwell, a student of prophecy who put it to political use in the reign of James VI and I, distinguished between the Welsh and \\"Caledonian\\" Merlins.

Biography Mas Mansoer was born on 25 June 1896 in Kampung Sawahan, north of Surabaya. His father was Kyai Hajji Mas Ahmad Marzuki, a descendant of the Sumenep royal family and a friend of Kyai Hajji Ahmad Dahlan. His mother was a woman from Surabaya who was of mixed Buginese and Minang descent. At the age of 12, Mansoer went to Mecca to study Islam. He then enrolled at Al-Azhar University in Egypt. During his studies, he read several Western literary works about freedom, humanism, and democracy. He also observed how Egyptian people fought against British colonists to obtain their independence, which influenced his later views. After graduating from Al-Azhar, Mansoer returned to Surabaya and became an ustaz at the Mufidah pesantren. During this period, he felt that the colonial government hindered the teaching of Islam. This situation made him join Muhammadiyah and Persatuan Bangsa Indonesia (Indonesian People's Association). He preached in remote areas. In 1914, Mansoer and Abdul Wahab Hasbullah (the cousin of Hasyim Asy'ari) founded an educational organization named Nahdhatul Wathan (Awakening of the Homeland). They also joined the Indonesche Study Club, an organization led by Dr. Sutomo. Later, he became a chairman of East Java branch of Muhammadiyah. In 1937, he became a chairman of Muhammadiyah through an election at the 26th Muhammadiyah Congress. Because of his widespread influence, the colonial government offered him a position in the Het Kantoor van Inlandsche Zaken as the head of institution of religious affairs. However, he refused it. Mansoer took the initiative in formatting the Majelis Islam A'la Indonesia on 25 September 1937. The purpose of the organization was to aid clerics throughout Indonesia in networking and building relationships with each other, both physically and spiritually. Under influence from the nationalism movement, MIAI was also involved in opposing the colonial government, such as in the like Gabungan Politik Indonesia (GAPI; Indonesian Political Federation) led by M. H. Thamrin. In 1938 he founded the Partai Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic Party) with Dr. Sukiman. During the Japanese occupation, Mansoer was under pressure due to his activities with Muhammadiyah. Mansoer, Kyai Hajji Wahid Hasyim, and Kyai Hajji Taufiqurrahman then formed an Islamic organization called Masyumi. After the group was formed, the Japanese government banned all political organizations and formed PUTERA (Pusat Tenaga Rakyat; previously Jawa Hokokai) to spread its propaganda. Mansoer, along with Soekarno, Mohammad Hatta, and Soewardi Soerjaningrat, were appointed as leaders in 1942; collectively they were known as the Empat Serangkai (Four Series). He accepted the appointment and resigned as Chairman of Muhammadiyah. Mansoer resigned from PUTERA in 1944 by reason of illness. During this period, Mansoer conveyed an idea of a roemah jang moerah dan sehat (\\"cheap and healthy house\\") in a meeting with other intellectuals and Japanese officers; this was hoped to solve housing problems faced by native Indonesians. His idea was supported by Soekarno. He also drew a blueprint for the project. Before the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, Mansoer became a member of the Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia (Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence). During the national revolution, Mansoer helped the people of Surabaya in defending the city against the British Army. Then, he was arrested by the Dutch, and was told to give a speech and convince the people of Surabaya to surrender; however, he refused. As a result, Mansoer was jailed in Kalisosok Prison in Surabaya. Mansoer died on 25 April 1946 in the prison. His remains were buried in Gipu, Surabaya. Religious views With respect to banking, Mansoer issued a fatwa that all kinds of bank interest are haraam (forbidden). However, doing business in banking was still allowed. On another issue, during the Nineteenth Congress of Muhammadiyah, Hajji Rasul contended that unisex majlis were haraam, but Mansoer disagreed. After discussing it, they agreed to declare them makruh (objectionable). In the purification of Islamic teachings, Mansoer prohibited bid‘ah, taqlid, and takhayul (superstition) in worship. He also forbade the tradition of grave pilgrimages, selametan, and doing a talqin for a body. He said that setbacks suffered by Muslims were caused by their weak beliefs and egoism, and that to fix these problems, Muslims should base their lives on the Quran and Hadiths. In his work Risalah Tawhid dan Sjirik (Treatise of Monotheism and Polytheism) he stated that another cause of Muslims' weakness was interference in Islamic thought and practices from polytheism. Legacy In 1964, Mansoer was awarded the title National Hero of Indonesia through Presidential Decree No.162/1964.

During her five years with Al Jazeera English, she filed some 400 reports,Goodbye to China, country of contradictions Al Jazeera English 13-May-2012. including stories on land confiscation and so-called \\"black jails.\\" Chan also reported stories from North Korea. In 2010, Chan wrote about the use of the money allocated to help survivors and for reconstruction following the 2010 Yushu earthquake. If the official numbers are correct, one could expect some big changes on the pitch. The Government of China passed a regulation requiring major NGOs to transfer all donations for the reconstruction to the local administrators. Officials say it's to better track - and make better use of - the US $ 1.57 billion in donations to help victims. But such a move has never happened before, and it sets a precedent which some say is a step backwards for civil society in China, putting all NGOs firmly under government control. In 2012, however, Chan's visa and press credentials were not renewed, forcing her to leave China. In the wake of her expulsion, the first of a foreign journalist since 1998, Al Jazeera English closed its Beijing bureau. The Chinese government provided no explanation for the move, though officials had previously accused Chan of unspecified violations of the law that were never clarified. Press reports and the Foreign Correspondent's Club of China connected the expulsion to a documentary on slave labor in Chinese jails aired by Al Jazeera English that had angered Chinese authorities. Chan had no part in the production of the piece, however, and her expulsion occurred in the context of multiple conflicts between foreign reporters and the Chinese government over denials or delays in obtaining journalist visas.

The exterior of the church features three gradually narrowing cylindrical levels formed by the faceted gallery, the main body of the church, and the drum of the dome.Janberidze, Nodar & Tsitsishvili, Irakly (1996), Architectural Monuments of Georgia, pp. 149–151. Stroyizdat, . კაცხის მონასტერი. saunje.ge. Accessed May 9, 2012. The six apses are inscribed into the outer polyhedron and surrounded by an ambulatory from all sides. An inscription from the ambulatory mentions the certain \\"Tskhovreba, daughter of Ioann, Duke of Dukes\\". A single spacious interior compartment around the subdome bay includes radially oriented semi- circular apses. One of these, the altar apse, projects outward prominently due to its large bema. The drum of the dome is also faceted. Each facet of the main body of the church as well as that of the dome and gallery terminate in a pediment with three lines of polygonal cornices. The building was richly ornated, but the decoration of two upper tiers was lost in the process of the 1854 restoration. Of note is a large composition in relief at the southern vestibule of the gallery, the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, featuring a cross supported by four angels. The church is surrounded by a pentagonal wall, which contains a free-standing bell tower in its eastern corner. These structures are later additions, probably from the 17th or 18th century.  History  The Exaltation of the Holy Cross, a relief from Katskhi The Katskhi monastery is located in the medieval district of Argveti, later part of Imereti. It was built in honor of the Holy Trinity at the behest of the late 10th-century nobleman Rati, of the house of Liparitids (Baguashi), who settled down in Argveti 988 after losing his stronghold of Kldekari to the Georgian Bagratids. The construction was completed around 1010–1014 in the reign of King Bagrat III of Georgia as suggested by a tympanum inscription over the south-western entrance. In the following centuries, Katskhi served as a familial abbey and burial ground for the Liparitids. According to the Georgian chronicles, the once-powerful Liparit IV was buried there after his death in exile in the Byzantine Empire. After the downfall of the Liparitid dynasty in the 11th century, the Katskhi monastery fell into oblivion. It reemerged from obscurity early in the 16th century, when Katskhi was granted by Bagrat III of Imereti to Prince Abulaskhar Amirejibi, who renovated the church and restored it to Christian use as the monastery of the Savior. By 1627, Katskhi appears in possession of the princely family of Abashidze, a member of which attained to the crown of Imereti as George VI from 1702 to 1707 and was buried at the Katskhi monastery after his death in exile in Tbilisi. The monastery was closed down by the Soviet authorities in 1924 and became functional again in 1990. The Katskhi monastery was also a vibrant center of Christian culture. Surviving medieval icons and manuscripts formerly held at Katskhi are preserved in the museums of Tbilisi.

Childhood  His exact date and even the year of his birth were not recorded, because in the medieval view the date the death of a person was far more important, as that was the date a memorial mass would be read. Nevertheless, the exact date of his death was not recorded either, because his family was silent about him after he was deposed. He was born around 1370, as the eldest son of Ulrich IV and his wife, Elisabeth of Wertheim. He inherited Hanau already in 1380. One of the sons of Ulrich IV was enrolled at the University of Heidelberg in 1390. The enrollment entry does not mention a first name -- it only names a .Gustav Toepke, Die Matrikel der Universität Heidelberg von 1386 – 1662, vol. 1, Heidelberg, 1884, p. 43Adolf Stölzel, Die Entwicklung des gelehrten Richtertums in den deutschen Territorien: Eine rechtsgeschichtliche Untersuchung mit vorzugsweiser Berücksichtigung der Verhältnisse im Gebiet des ehemaligen Kurfürstentums Hessen, vol. 2, Stuttgart, 1872, reprinted: 1964, p. 52. This source erroneously states the year as 1389 Since Ulrich V was already ruling Hanau at this time, it would be unlikely that he was this student.  Regency  Since he was a minor when he inherited Hanau in 1380, a regency was set up. The father of his fiancée, Count Gottfried VIII of Ziegenhain acted as regent until .  Reign  In 1389, he fought on the side of Elector Palatine Rupert I in the Cities War, a conflict between the emerging cities and the nobility, and on the victorious side in the Feud of Kronberg. In 1400, he was among the Burgmanns of Friedberg who were sent to the newly elected King Rupert of the Romans, to negotiate about the homage, after King Wenceslaus had been deposed.  Government crisis and deposition  There were two main reasons why Ulrich V was deposed by his relatives: * The absence of a male heir threatened the survival of the family. In 1375, his father had confirmed the primogeniture decree, which Ulrich II had issued in 1339. The threat was reduced by family treaty of 1391, which allowed his brother Reinhard II to marry if Ulrich V still had no male heir ten years later, that is, in 1401. * Ulrich V ran into economic difficulties from 1394, and even more so after 1396, even though he had received compensation payments from the city of Frankfurt after the Feud of Kronberg. Apparently, he had overstretched himself in his \\"foreign policy\\". He mortgaged the village of Hochstadt to Frankfurt, the district of Joßgrund to the Lords of Thüngen, and in the end, he even mortgaged the two major of the four cities in his territory, Hanau and Babenhausen to his neighbor, political rival and first cousin once removed, Archbishop John II of Mainz, effectively making him co-ruler of the Lordship of Hanau. From , a coalition consisting of Reinhard II and his younger brother, John began acting independently and even against Ulrich V. This led to an open dispute, which was settled by a compromise in 1398. However, the dispute emerged again, and grew to the level of a feud. From 1400, and more so from 1402, Reinhard II and John sought support from Archbishop John II of Mainz, who eventually changed sides and dropped his support of Ulrich V. In 1404, Ulrich V gradually lost power. On 20 February 1404, Reinhard II and John took up government; on 20 November 1404, Ulrich formally abdicated and ordered his subjects to pay homage to his brothers. His wife had already renounced any claims she might have on Hanau earlier that year, in return for a monetary compensation, without Ulrich V being even mentioned in the contract. Historians in the 18th and 19th century have suggested that Ulrich V may have suffered from a mental disorder. This disorder would have justified setting aside the primogeniture decree for just one generation. However, there is no contemporary evidence to support this theory. Reinhard II and John ruled jointly at first. After John died in 1411, Reinhard II ruled alone.  Death  Little is known about Ulrich V after his abdication. He is reported to have resided in Frankfurt for a while, and later in the district of Babenhausen. He probably died in 1419 in Schaafheim.  Marriage and issue  In 1394, Ulrich V married Elisabeth ( - 1 December 1431), the daughter of Count Gottfried VIII of Ziegenhain. They had three daughters: # Elisabeth (d. 1475), married in 1413 to Albert I of Hohenlohe (d. 15 June 1429) # Agnes (d. 22 November 1446), abbess of Klarenthal Abbey # Adelaide (d. 13 November 1440), a nun at Klarenthal Abbey  Ancestors   References  * Reinhard Dietrich: Die Abdankung Ulrichs V. von Hanau – Ursachen und Folgen, in: Hanauer Geschichtsblätter, vol. 31, Hanau, 1993 * Reinhard Dietrich: Die Landesverfassung in dem Hanauischen = Hanauer Geschichtsblätter, vol. 34, Hanau, 1996, * Reinhard Suchier: Genealogie des Hanauer Grafenhauses, in: Festschrift des Hanauer Geschichtsvereins zu seiner fünfzigjährigen Jubelfeier am 27.

It is based on the play Accent on Youth written by Samson Raphaelson. Filming took place from October to December 1949 in Hollywood. Plot New York theater producer Alex Conway (Charles Coburn) travels with composer Paul Merrick (Bing Crosby) to Lawford College, Paul's alma mater, where one of his musicals is being revived by the students. The current campus hero is handsome athlete Jefferson Blake (Robert Stack), so Katherine Holbrook (Nancy Olson), class valedictorian and chairman of the welcoming committee for returning alumni, asks Paul to work in a phrase about Jeff in one of his songs. Paul balks at the suggestion, but Kate's matter-of-fact manner leaves no room for discussion. Paul is persuaded to take part in the show, and he sings \\"And You'll Be Home\\". Lawrence Welk's champagne lady, Norma Zimmer sings the obligato, while sitting next to Bing during the song. After the show, Paul and Alex return to New York, and although Paul is broke, he would rather play golf than work. When he asks Alex for a $15,000 advance against his next musical, which Alex intends to produce with financing from multi-millionaire Tippy Carpenter (Donald Woods), Alex agrees on condition that Paul take on a secretary, who will make sure that he works and will not squander the money. Paul laughingly accepts, but has second thoughts when he finds that Alex has hired the ever-serious Kate. Kate continually hounds him to work, but Paul snubs her efforts so that he can play golf and entertain Lorna Marvis (Ruth Hussey), his girlfriend. Frustrated by her lack of success, Kate, an aspiring psychiatrist, accuses Paul of being afraid of failure. Paul intends to fire Kate, but feels guilty because he would be breaking his agreement with Alex. Lorna announces her intention to marry Tippy for his money. Paul then discovers that Kate and her Aunt Amy (Ida Moore) have moved into the guest room of his penthouse apartment. Paul gets to work composing a new score, and when Jeff comes to town, Paul encourages him to take Kate out. For the first time, Jeff sees Kate's charms and kisses her, even though it means breaking training. However, Kate discovers that she is more interested in Paul, who is older, than in Jeff. After three weeks, Paul throws a party to celebrate the fact that he has written eight songs and completed the score for the musical revue, Mr. Music. The day after the party, Jeff tells Paul that he is losing competitions because he cannot stop thinking about Kate, even though he knows Kate is in love with Paul. Paul is surprised to hear about Kate's feelings, and when Lorna returns to him, and they become engaged, he tells Kate about Jeff's visit, and that she should pursue someone closer to her own age. Kate is devastated, and plans to quit, but refrains when she learns that Tippy has pulled his money from the show. Aunt Amy tries to interest her wealthy friend, Jerome Thisbee (Richard Haydn using the pseudonym Claud Curdle), in backing the show, but Alex and Paul are disappointed when Thisbee offers only $300, not the $300,000 they need. Kate then announces her plan to return to graduate school, but instead returns to Lawford after Paul's butler, \\"Cupcake\\" Haggerty (Tom Ewell), brings news that the Friars' Club has agreed to help them. Some time later, Paul brings Alex to Lawford to let him in on the surprise: The college students, aided by name performers such as comedian Groucho Marx, Metropolitan Opera singer Dorothy Kirsten, dancers Marge, and Gower Champion, who portray themselves along with the singing group The Merry Macs, have put on Mr. Music for the benefit of several potential backers. Although the backers refuse to finance the show with Alex as producer, Thisbee comes through with a certified check for $300,000. Lorna, who realizes she is more interested in money than Paul, ends their engagement and asks Kate to return the ring. As Kate has rejected Jeff, who is back on a winning streak, she asks Paul if she can keep the ring, and when he consents, they become engaged.

He composed it in Leipzig for , the fifth Sunday after Easter, and first performed it on 6 May 1725.  History and words  Bach composed the cantata in Leipzig in his second annual cycle for the Fifth Sunday after Easter, called Rogate. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle of James, \\"doers of the word, not only listeners\\" () and from the Gospel of John, from the farewell discourses of Jesus, \\"prayers will be fulfilled\\" (). In his second year Bach had composed chorale cantatas between the first Sunday after Trinity and Palm Sunday, but for Easter returned to cantatas on more varied texts, possibly because he lost his librettist. The cantata is the third of nine for the period between Easter and Pentecost based on texts of Christiana Mariana von Ziegler. Her cantatas for the period deal with \\"the understanding of Jesus' suffering within the context of victory and love, increasingly articulating how the tribulation of the world is overcome\\", according to American musicologist Eric Chafe. The text begins, as do several others of the period, with a bass solo as the vox Christi delivering a quotation from the Gospel, verse 24. The poet interprets it as a reproach. The final lines from the second movement, an aria, are a paraphrase of another Gospel verse. One recitative is not part of the printed publication. Alfred Dürr assumes that Bach wrote it himself to improve the connection to the following Gospel quotation in movement 5. The poet used as the closing chorale the ninth stanza of Heinrich Müller's hymn \\"\\" (1659). Bach first performed the cantata on 6 May 1725.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in seven movements is scored for three vocal soloists (alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir only for the closing chorale, two oboes, two oboes da caccia, two violins, viola and basso continuo. # Arioso (bass): # Recitative (alto): # Aria (alto): # Recitative (tenor): # Arioso (bass): # Aria (tenor): # Chorale:  Music  As in the cantata for the same occasion in Bach's first year in Leipzig, , the text begins with words of Jesus from the gospel, sung by the bass as the vox Christi, accompanied by the strings, doubled by the oboes. It is formally free and untitled, but resembles a fugue because the instruments enter in imitation, and the voice sings a similar theme. A secco recitative leads to an alto aria with two obbligato oboi da caccia. The prayer for forgiveness (Forgive, o Father, our guilt) is illustrated by sighing motifs. The second recitative is accompanied by the strings and ends in an arioso on the words \\"\\" (therefore seek to comfort me). In movement 5, the bass renders another word of Jesus from the Gospel, \\"\\" (In the world you have fear; however be comforted, I have conquered the world). The music is serious, the voice only accompanied by the continuo, referring to the Passion as the price for the \\"comfort\\". Christoph Wolff notes the \\"almost hymn-like emphasis through measured, arioso declamation ... In the central fifth movement Bach reduces the accompaniment to the continuo, another means of underscoring the importance of Jesus’ words.\\" In response, the last aria expresses joy in suffering. Its pastoral mood, created by dotted rhythm in 12/8 time, has been compared to the Sinfonia beginning Part II of Bach's Christmas Oratorio. The closing chorale on the melody of \\"\\" by Johann Crüger is set for four parts.  Recordings  * Les Grandes Cantates de J. S.

Kirkland (February 10, 1904 or 1906 – April 6, 1988) was an American arranger, bandleader, guitarist and songwriter whose career spanned the eras of big band jazz, R&B;, rock and roll and soul. Life and career Born in Columbia, South Carolina, in either 1904 or 1906 (sources differ), Kirkland played guitar in southern jazz bands in the 1920s, and after a spell in the army worked as arranger and songwriter for Erskine Hawkins. He joined Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey in the 1940s, and in 1951 began arranging music at Savoy Records in New York. He continued to arrange R&B; artists for OKeh Records, Mercury Records and other companies, and worked on rock and roll shows with Alan Freed. He also directed \\"My Favorite Song\\" for Ella Fitzgerald on Decca Records (Decca #9-28433). Two of his compositions became popular with jazz musicians: \\"Charleston Alley\\" (recorded by Lambert, Hendricks & Ross, Charlie Barnet, and others) and \\"Cloudburst\\" (recorded by Count Basie, The Pointer Sisters, and others). Some of Kirkland's more successful collaborations were with Screamin' Jay Hawkins (\\"I Put a Spell on You, \\"Little Demon\\",\\"Yellow Coat\\", etc.) and Big Maybelle (Kirkland co-wrote her biggest hit, \\"Gabbin' Blues\\"). In 1956, Kirkland and his session band teamed up with 14-year-old singer Barbie Gaye to record an R&B; song, \\"My Boy Lollypop\\". When the song was covered eight years later by Jamaican artist Millie Small, the cover version became a worldwide hit. Later at Savoy Records, Kirkland worked with Nappy Brown and Wilbert Harrison. Although behind the scenes for most of his career, Kirkland contributed to the recordings of music legends such as Etta James, Charlie Parker, Ella Fitzgerald, The Righteous Brothers, The Supremes, Brook Benton and the Five Satins.

Two bombs exploded which wounded 65 people and damaged many buildings in the city of Manchester. Bombing The first bomb to explode was inside a car that was parked at Parsonage Gardens in the commercial district of the city. The car bomb was behind a shop of House of Fraser () It exploded at 8:31 am. The bombing in Parsonage Gardens injured six people. The second bomb exploded on Cateaton Street between a market and Manchester Cathedral () at 10:09 am,. and wounded 58 people. Many buildings were damaged in the bombings. The impact smashed the face of the cathedral clock and its stained glass windows. The cathedral provided refuge to hundreds who moved out of Deansgate. The total wounded in the blasts was 65. Aftermath A phone call was made after the bombings, claiming more devices were in the city, forcing the police to evacuate the entire city centre of shoppers, and telling others to remain indoors. No other bombs were found. The damage was estimated to have been to the value of £10 million (equivalent to about £19 million in 2017). Perpetrators The Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing the next day, part of the group's 1990s bombing campaign in England. They detonated another, much more powerful bomb in Manchester four years later.

She was a founder of the organization in 1986 which produced the well-known commercial This is your brain on drugs and other \\"hard-hitting, unsentimental ads\\" which depicted the \\"unglamorous reality of drug abuse\\". As research director, she studied the consumer motivations of drug users by means of marketing research methods including focus groups, quantitative surveys, and advertising research, and she led media campaigns directed at specific audiences such as inner-city youth, pre- teens, and parents. In addition, she often served as the organization's spokesperson, by giving speeches at numerous press conferences, by speaking at universities such as Colgate University, appearing on television, in print media, and on radio. She is regarded as an authority on anti-drug advertising efforts. Beginnings Ginna Marston. Marston is the daughter of late advertising agency executive and copywriter Sandy Sulcer who has been credited for co-writing the Put a Tiger in Your Tank advertising theme for Exxon along with Ernest Dichter. She graduated cum laude from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1976. She graduated cum laude with an A.B. in comparative literature from Princeton University in 1980 after completing a 329-page long senior thesis titled \\"The Grotesque as a Comparative Concept in Modern Narrative: Donoso, Gautier, Poe, Hoffman, Balzac.\\" She worked at the Ted Bates advertising agency before joining the Partnership for a Drug-Free America in 1986 as one of the founders. Partnership for a Drug-Free America The agency was formed during the middle 1980s by key professionals working under the auspices of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, and included Phillip Joanou, Thomas Hedrick, Doria Steedman, and Marston. The thinking was that if advertising could create demand for helpful consumer products such as toothpaste and soft drinks, then advertising could shrink demand for dangerous addicting substances such as illegal drugs. Grants from the advertising association, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and a wide assortment of businesses provided funding to enable the agency to operate. The first priority was understanding attitudes associated with decisions to use drugs, and the organization devoted substantial resources towards studying these motivations. Marston identified two key perceptions involved with the decision by young kids to experiment with drugs: (1) the risk to the user and (2) possible social disapproval, and the resulting media campaigns focused on both messages. The group collaborated with anti-drug crusaders such as Carole Fields-Arnold. Marston described the Partnership's mission: In the middle of the 1990s, research suggested that not only teenagers were vulnerable to drugs, but pre-teenagers as well, and Marston led an advertising effort to discourage early experimentation. She worked with retired Johnson & Johnson chief executive James E. Burke. She led anti-drug advertising efforts geared towards inner-city youth, and towards discouraging use of specific substances such as heroin, Ecstasy, and marijuana. The organization focused anti-drug messages on parents too: Marston advised the National Institutes of Health on anti-drug advertising strategies, and urged game designers to not glamorize drugs in video games. In 1999, she appeared in the Robert Zemeckis film entitled Smoking, Drinking and Drugging as a spokesperson. The decades-long effort by the Partnership has been studied written up in case-studies for the Harvard Business School as well as educational presentations for the Advertising Educational Foundation. Personal life Marston worked with top creative talents such as actor and comedian Bill Cosby to produce PSAs for the Partnership. This photo, by photographer and director Bobby Sheehan, shows Cosby reviewing a script before filming in Astoria, Queens. Marston with award-winning filmmaker Bobby Sheehan (left) and Bill Cosby. Marston is married with two children. In addition to advertising, Marston is a singer- songwriter and has performed in local venues.Check with PERFORMERS ...

These three sectors (water, energy and food security nexus) are necessary for the benefit of human well-being, poverty reduction and sustainable development. As the world population is nearing 8 billion, increasing demands for basic services also rise, such as the growing desires for higher living standards and the need for more conscious stewardship of the vital resources required to achieve those services and these desires have become both more obvious and urgent. Water- food-energy connections lie at the heart of sustainable, economic and environmental development and protection. The demand for all three resources continues to grow for various reasons: a growing population, ongoing population movements from farms to cities, rising incomes, increased desire to spend those incomes on energy and water intensive goods/varying diets, international trade, urbanization and climate change. Water being a finite resource, but also the most abundant resource of the three sectors is the most exploited. Water is primarily used in forestry and fishery, agricultural production (in its entire agri-food supply chain) and is used to create and/or transfer energy in varying forms. In fact, agriculture is the largest user of freshwater, making it responsible for 70% of total global withdrawal, while more than one fourth of energy used worldwide is an input for food production, distribution, and use. In addition, food production and supply chain simultaneously utilize approximately 30% of the total energy that is used globally. The greater the capacity to pay for improved water, the more it will enable alternative water sources, such as desalination to bring water into urban areas from greater distances, such as desalinated seawater often requiring energy-intensive production and transport methods. Countries, food, water and energy industries, as well as other users can agree that the increasing use of more water, energy and land resources (food) have a great potential to face issues with environmental deterioration and even resource scarcity, as we can already see taking place in some parts of the developing world. The unbroken links between these sectors continues to demand well- integrated plans to protect food and water and food security.  Definitions * The nexus approach is deemed necessary to design future, inherently interlinked systems from the starting point of planning in a holistic manner. Concepts such as integrated management consider at least one of the systems as an existing system and are therefore different from the nexus approach. This approach identifies the future systems as inherently interconnected. The nexus approach aims to highlight potential synergies and identify critical conflicts to be dealt with. *Water security is defined in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as \\"access to safe drinking water and sanitation\\",UNDP: Millennium Development Goals, Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability both of which have recently become a human right. While not part of most water security definitions yet, availability of and access to water for other human and ecosystem uses is also very important from a nexus perspective. * Energy security has been defined as \\"access to clean, reliable and affordable energy services for cooking and heating, lighting, communications and productive uses\\" (United Nations),UN Secretary General’s Advisory Group on Energy and Climate Change (AGECC), Summary Report and Recommendations, 28 April 2010, p. 13 and as \\"uninterrupted physical availability [of energy] at a price which is affordable, while respecting environment concerns\\". * Food security is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as \\"availability and access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet the dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\\".FAO. 1996. Rome Declaration on World Food Security and World Food Summit Plan of Action. World Food Summit 13–17 November 1996. Rome. Adequate food has also been defined as a human right. The emphasis on access in these definitions also implies that security is not so much about average (e.g., annual) availability of resources; it has to encompass variability and extreme situations such as droughts or price shocks, and the psychological resilience of the poor.  Interactions among the water, energy and food security sectors  The interactions among water, energy and food are numerous and substantial. Water is used for extraction, mining, processing, refining, and residue disposal of fossil fuels, as well as for growing feedstock for biofuels and for generating electricity. Water intensity varies in the energy sector, with oil and gas production requiring much less water than oil from tar sands or biofuels. Choosing biofuels for energy production should require a careful balancing of priorities, since water that has been used to grow feedstock for biofuels could also have been used to grow food.Many forms of energy production through fossil fuels are highly polluting in addition to being water intensive, especially extraction from tar sands and shale and extraction through hydraulic fracturing. Further, return flows from power plants to rivers are warmer than the water that was taken in and/or are highly polluted and can consequently compromise other downstream usage, including ecosystems. Conversely, energy is needed for extracting, transporting, distributing and treating water. Energy intensity for accessing a cubic meter of water varies: logically, accessing local surface water requires far less energy than pumping groundwater, reclaiming wastewater or desalinating seawater. Irrigation is more energy intensive than rain-fed agriculture, and drip irrigation is more intensive yet since the water must be pressurized. Food production is by far the largest consumer of global fresh water supplies. Globally, agriculture is responsible for an average of 70% of fresh water consumption by humans; in some countries that figure jumps to 80%-90%. Agriculture is therefore also responsible for much of fresh water over-exploitation. Food production further impacts the water sector through land degradation, changes in runoff, disruption of groundwater discharge, water quality and availability of water and land for other purposes such as natural habitat. The increased yields that have resulted from mechanization and other modern measures have come at a high energy price, as the full food and supply chain claims approximately 30% of total global energy demand. Energy fuels land preparation, fertilizer production, irrigation and the sowing, harvesting and transportation of crops. The links between food and energy have become quite apparent in recent years as increases in the price of oil lead very quickly to increases in the price of food. The energy sector can have other negative impacts on the food sector when mining for fossil fuels and deforestation for biofuels reduce land for agriculture, ecosystems and other uses. The measurement of the water-energy-food nexus is complex in that the constituent sectors are measured in different units. They also vary both spatially and temporally. One means of measuring a nexus is through the development of a composite indicator or Index (statistics) such as the WEF Nexus Index . The development of a composite indicator normalises the data, thus enabling the constituent indicators (representing water, energy and food) to be aggregated. The water, energy and food pillars within this index are equally weighted, thus emphasizing the multi-centric nature of this framework. The WEF Nexus Index should be utilised as an entry point into the underlying pillars, sub-pillars and indicators, and can be utilised in parallel with other quantitative and qualitative water-energy-food nexus studies. Further, it is complementary to the Sustainable Development Goals in that its access sub-pillars are centred on equitable access to the constituent resources.  Nexus approach  Improved water, energy, and food security on a global level can be achieved through a nexus approach—an approach that integrates management and governance across sectors and scales. A nexus approach can support the transition to a Green Economy, which aims, among other things, at resource use efficiency and greater policy coherence. Given the increasing connectivity across sectors and in space and time, a reduction of negative economic, social and environmental externalities can increase overall resource use efficiency, provide additional benefits and secure the human rights to water and food. In a nexus-based approach, conventional policy- and decision- making in \\"silos\\" therefore would give way to an approach that reduces trade- offs and builds synergies across sectors. The European Union, working along with the German Federal Ministry for Economics Cooperation and Development and the International Food Policy Research Institute, the WWF and the World Economic Forum have developed an online resource on this concern. Nexus approach requires an integrated solution.  Nexus perspective  A nexus perspective increases the understanding of the inter-dependencies across the water, energy and food sectors and influences policies in other areas of concern such as climate and biodiversity. The nexus perspective helps to move beyond silos and ivory towers that preclude interdisciplinary solutions, thus increasing opportunities for mutually beneficial responses and enhancing the potential for cooperation between and among all sectors. Everyone in all disciplines needs to think and act from the perspective of being interlinked in order to realize the full impact of both direct and indirect synergies that can result. A deep understanding of the nexus will provide the informed and transparent framework that is required to meet increasing global demands without compromising sustainability. The nexus approach will also allow decision-makers to develop appropriate policies, strategies and investments, to explore and exploit synergies, and to identify and mitigate trade-offs among the development goals related to water, energy and food security. Active participation by and among government agencies, the private sector and civil society is critical to avoiding unintended adverse consequences. A true nexus approach can only be achieved through close collaboration of all actors from all sectors. While the opportunities provided by the nexus perspective and the consequent social, environmental and economic benefits are real, implementation requires the right policies, incentives and encouragement, and institutions and leaders that are up to the task, as well as frameworks that encourage empowerment, research, information and education. Accelerating the involvement of the private sector through establishing and promoting the business case for both sustainability and the nexus is essential to driving change and getting to scale. Nexus perspective can be an option for adaptation to climate change.. This article highlights that Nepal can use groundwater resources to irrigate presently non-irrigated land to provide year-round irrigation. This can boost agriculture production and other associated economic benefits.

Bred from Border Collies, Heading Dogs are a sturdy, long-legged and even-haired breed. They are generally black and white in color, but may also be tan.  History  The New Zealand Heading Dog is descended from the Border Collie, a breed of dog originally from the Scottish border. Early settlers brought these dogs to New Zealand to herd sheep, then went on to breed more specified dogs. Due to the Border Collie's long hair, they were bred with shorter haired dogs to create a breed that was better suited to the hot summers of the local environment. They were also bred to have less of an instinct to lie down than a border collie, standing still on their feet to make them more visible to the shepherd at long distance in the native tussock, and to run longer distances, and in some lines to be larger and more \\"hard nosed\\" to deal more easily with cattle. The New Zealand Heading Dog has since been an integral part of sheepdog trials, which began in New Zealand as early as 1867 in Wanaka. The competitive dog sport involves herding sheep around a field and into enclosures.  Description  New Zealand Heading Dogs are very aware of their surroundings and are able to adapt to quick movements that are in their line of sight, suiting their shepherding requirements, and are able to run long distances day after day. These types of dogs are specifically bred and trained to work in farms to circle sheep. They are medium to large dogs with long, smooth, straight hair. New Zealand Heading Dogs are often black and white, but some may be tan or other colors, with mostly white dogs being unpopular both because they are hard to distinguish from sheep at distance and because they tend to spook the sheep when they suddenly recognize what they thought was a sheep is in fact a dog. A rarer recessive trait brings out a reddish coat, which is unpopular due to blending in to tussock and dry summer grass. The breed requires an agrarian environment and are generally not intended to be kept as house pets. New Zealand Heading Dogs are extremely intelligent, active dogs with instinct to herd animals; if left alone for too long, they may try to escape and/or herd small animals or children.

He is known for his friendship with Pablo Picasso, who painted several portraits of Casagemas. They traveled around Spain and eventually to Paris, where they lived together in a vacant studio. Casagemas fell in love with Germaine, a model they had portrayed, however Casagemas was unable to consummate the relationship due to impotence. This, along with his descent into depression and mood swings, led to several suicide attempts.

The opening of one of her operas, Schiava et Regina, had to be postponed due to the bombing of the Gran Teatre del Liceu by anarchists. The family owned multiple properties, including a vacation house in Sitges and in Badalona, where Casagemas and Picasso spent time together. As a teenager, Casagemas and group of friends formed the grup bohemi-barceloní (the Barcelona-Bohemian Group) and spent significant time at Els Quatre Gats, a well-known meeting place for Catalan Modernist arts. Casagemas formed strong political views during his teenage years becoming a self-declared anarchist and a Catalanista (Catalan nationalist), even taking part in demonstration and having a run-in with police. During this time, Casagemas also began abusing alcohol and various narcotics.  Friendship with Picasso Casagemas met Picasso in 1899. The two quickly became close friends, traveled around Spain together, and then shared a studio on Carrer Riera de Sant Joan in Barcelona at the beginning of 1900. Picasso painted multiple portraits of Casagemas around that time. During the early months of their friendship, Casagemas showed signs of depression, mood swings, and impotence. Notably, Picasso and Casagemas frequented brothels in Barcelona, where Casagemas could not have sex with the prostitutes and would simply wait for Picasso. In February 1900, Picasso had his first solo exhibit at Els Quatre Gats. One of the three oil paintings exhibited in that show, entitled Last Moments, was selected to be included in Paris's Exposition Universelle. (Last Moments no longer exists in its original form, having been painted over by Picasso in 1903 as La Vie, an allegorical work featuring Casagemas.) Casagemas also put up an exhibit at Els Quatre Gats just after Picasso's, in late March and early April of 1900. The exhibit received mixed reviews.  Paris 1900-1901  In October 1900, Casagemas accompanied Picasso to Paris for the Exposition. Eventually, the two took up residence in a vacated studio owned by Isidre Nonell located in Montmartre. Germaine Gargallo Florentin Pichot (best known as Germaine), Germaine's sister (Antoinette Fornerod), and a close friend, Louise \\"Oddette\\" Lenoir became models and constant companions of Picasso and Casagemas. Casagemas quickly fell in love with Germaine, while Odette began sleeping with Picasso.The Guardian, Jonathan Jones, The Three Dancers, Pablo Picasso (1925) Despite his deep feelings for Germaine, Casagemas, due to his impotence, could not consummate their relationship and quickly fell into a deep depression. Casagemas spoke of suicide often and attempted to kill himself at least once before Picasso suggested that they leave Paris and return to Spain for the holidays. They spent Christmas 1900 in Barcelona and then traveled to Malaga, Picasso's birthplace, on New Year's Day 1901. There Casagemas's behavior towards Picasso's relatives embarrassed Picasso so deeply that Picasso put him on a boat back to Barcelona. After passing through Barcelona, Casagemas returned to Paris on his own to see Germaine. Throughout his absence from Paris, Casagemas had been writing to Germaine multiple times a day. Not much is known about the three weeks Casagemas spent in Paris after his arrival in early 1901, except that he asked Germaine to live with him and she refused. But he soon decided that he would again return to Spain.  Suicide  On February 17, 1901, Casagemas arranged a farewell dinner for himself at the Hippodrome Cafe in Paris. He invited Germaine and a few friends, including Manuel Pallarés and Manolo Hugué. At approximately 9pm and after many rounds of wine and absinthe, Casagemas asked Germaine one final time if she would marry him. When she refused, he drew a pistol and shot at her. The bullet did not strike her, but she fell to the ground. Casagemas then turned the gun and shot himself in the right temple. He died in a hospital later that evening. One of Picasso's portraits accompanied Casagemas's obituary nine days later. Picasso returned to Paris in May, 1901, resumed residence in the studio that he had shared with Casagemas, visited the site of Casagemas's suicide, and eventually had an affair with Germaine. During the years to follow, Picasso painted various death portraits of Casagemas. Germaine remained part of Picasso's life for many years and was later one of the models depicted in Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.  Solo exhibit  In 2014, the National Art Museum of Catalonia (Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, MNAC) put up the first major exhibit dedicated solely to Casagemas's work.  In popular culture  Robert Sheehan portrayed Casagemas in the 2018 season of the television series Genius, which focuses on the life and career of Pablo Picasso.

It is located in Zone 8, in the Musocco district (formerly a comune of its own), not far from the Garegnano Charterhouse. The cemetery has an overall area of 678,624 m2 (including 80,000 m2 of green space) with over 500,000 graves. Cimitero Maggiore di Milano History In the 19th century, as a consequence of the rapid demographic growth of Milan, a thorough reorganization of the cemeteries of the city was due. At the time, Milan had a large number of small cemeteries located in areas that were originally peripheral but, as the city expanded, had experienced a quick urbanization. Plans were made to close down most of these small cemeteries and build a few, larger ones, in the outskirts of the city. The Monumentale was built first (in the early decades of the century), but it soon became clear that at least another large cemetery was needed. Core samples proved that the rural area of Musocco, bordering on Milan, had suitable geological properties; after some quarrel with Musocco's administration, construction began in the late 19th century, on a design by architects Luigi Mazzocchi and Enrico Brotti. The cemetery opened in 1895; Storia di Milano: I cimiteri milaesi - Cimitero di Musocco it originally covered an area of 400,000 m2. Graves from at least four different cemeteries were moved to the Maggiore. A dedicated tram was employed to move the graves; it is said that the people of Milan nicknamed this tram \\"La Gioconda\\" (\\"the joyful one\\"). Benito Mussolini was buried in an unmarked grave in the Maggiore immediately after his death, although his corpse was later moved, to be eventually buried again in his hometown Predappio.

In 1926 he started as a surveyor’s assistant on the Geological Survey of British Guiana under the supervision of H. J. C. (Terence) Conolly. King obtained his surveyor’s licence in 1929 and then moved to Canada where he studied mining engineering at the University of Toronto (B.A.Sc., 1934). King gained experience in mineral exploration working with Conolly in the Timmins and Sudbury Basin regions. King was invited to join the newly formed Western Mining Corporation in Western Australia in 1934 \`to apply the latest ideas in geology, geophysics, geochemistry and aerial photography to the scientific search for new mineral deposits’, collaborating with U.S. consultants. King became senior geologist in 1936. In 1953, King became chief geologist of Consolidated Zinc.

*John Tavener *Pēteris Vasks Precedent composers Other composers whose works have been described as precedents to minimalism include: *Jakob van Domselaer, whose early-20th century experiments in translating the theories of Piet Mondrian's De Stijl movement into music represent an early precedent to minimalist music. *Alexander Mosolov, whose orchestral composition Iron Foundry (1923) is made up of mechanical and repetitive patterns *George Antheil, whose 1924 Ballet Mecanique is characterized by much use of motoric and repetitive patterns, as well as an instrumentation made up of multiple player pianos and mallet percussion *Erik Satie, seen as a precursor of minimalism as in much of his music, for example his score for Francis Picabia's 1924 film Entr'acte which consists of phrases, many borrowed from bawdy popular songs, ordered seemingly arbitrarily and repetitiously, providing a rhythmic counterpoint to the film. *Colin McPhee, whose Tabuh- Tabuhan for two pianos and orchestra (1936) features the use of motoric, repetitive, pentatonic patterns drawn from the music of Bali (and featuring a large section of tuned percussion) *Carl Orff, who, particularly in his later theater works Antigonae (1940–49) and Oedipus der Tyrann (1957–58), utilized instrumentations (six pianos and multiple xylophones, in imitation of gamelan music) and musical patterns (motoric, repetitive, triadic) reminiscent of the later music of Steve Reich and Philip Glass *Yves Klein, whose 1949 Monotone Symphony (formally The Monotone-Silence Symphony, conceived 1947–1948) is an orchestral 40-minute piece whose first movement is an unvarying 20-minute drone and the second and last movement a 20-minute silence,Perlein and Corà 2000, 226: \\"This symphony, 40 minutes in length (in fact 20 minutes followed by 20 minutes of silence) is constituted of a single 'sound' stretched out, deprived of its attack and end which creates a sensation of vertigo, whirling the sensibility outside time.\\"See also at YvesKleinArchives.org a 1998 sound excerpt of The Monotone Symphony (Flash plugin required), its short description , and Klein's \\"Chelsea Hotel Manifesto\\" (including a summary of the 2-part Symphony). predating by several years both the drone music works of La Monte Young and the \\"silent\\" 4'33\\" of John Cage. *Morton Feldman, whose works prominently feature some sort of repetition as well as a sparseness *Alvin Lucier, whose acoustical experiments demand a stripped-down musical surface to bring out details in the phenomena *Anton Webern, whose economy of materials and sparse textures led many of the minimalists who were educated in serialism to turn to a reduction of means. *Alphonse Allais is the author of the earliest known example of a completely silent musical composition. His Funeral March for the Obsequies of a Great Deaf Man of 1897 consists of twenty-four blank measures. The fact that this is his one and only composition makes him all the more a precursor of minimalism in music.

Biography Born in Rome to Rafael Leonori and Anna Ianari, he entered the Roman College at the age of 8, and in 1875, at the age of nineteen, he graduated with a degree in civil engineering. He mainly worked in building churches and religious structures. Among these, he designed the chapel of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in the famed Sant'Andrea della Valle in Rome. In Rome, Leonori designed at least five churches and several hospitals, including San Patrizio, the Irish National Church in Rome, completed in 1892, and Santa Croce in Via Flaminia in 1912 and the Basilica church of San Giuseppe al Trionfale in the Trionfale quartiere of Rome. One of his biggest projects was the design and construction of the Church of St. Joseph in Cairo, Egypt, built in 1909. He helped design the belltower for the Shrine of the Virgin of the Rosary of Pompei (1912) in Pompeii, Italy. In addition to designing The Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Land in Washington, D.C.,Photos of Franciscan Monastery in Washington, D.C. Leonori contributed to several other magnificent churches in the United States: the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis (1907); St. Joseph’s (New) Cathedral in Buffalo, New York (1912); and Holy Rosary Church in Washington, D.C. (1923). Between 1898 and 1913, he published in Rome a twice-monthly magazine in Latin titled Vox Urbis: de litteris et bonis artibus commentarius. He died in Rome in 1928.

Patt Lalor first came to prominence as a leader of the resistance to tithes in Queen's County during the Tithe War 1831-36 when he refused to pay tithes to support the Church of Ireland and allowed his sheep to be confiscated as a result. Lalor declared at a public meeting in February 1831 in Maryborough that \\"...he would never again pay tithes; that he would violate no law; that the tithe men might take his property, and offer it for sale; but his countrymen, he was proud to say, respected him, and he thought that none of them would buy or bid for it if exposed for sale. The declaration was received by the meeting in various ways: by many with surprise and astonishment; by others with consternation and dismay, but by a vast majority with tremendous cheering.\\"William Lalor quoted in John O'Hanlon ed. \\"History of the Queen's County\\" Vol 2 1914 pp. 653-6 on www.archive.org Lalor held true to his word and did not resist the confiscation of 20 sheep from his farm, but was able to ensure no buyers appeared at subsequent auctions. Following Catholic Emancipation, he was elected to the House of Commons in 1832 but narrowly defeated in 1835. In his later years, he served as a justice of the peace for Queen's County and as a prominent member of the Tenant Right League supporting land reform. He died at his residence \\"Tenakill\\" near Mountrath on 10 April 1856 aged 75. Patt Lalor married Anne Dillon (died 4/6/1835), the daughter of Patrick Dillon of Sheane, and had 13 children. After her death, he married Ellen Mary Anne Loughnan with whom he had no children. His son Richard Lalor and great grandson John Lalor Fitzpatrick also represented Queen's County in the House of Commons. His first cousins included Alice Lalor (1769–1846), the American religious leader, Dr Joseph Lalor (1811–86) the reformist Medical Superintendent of the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum, and Joseph O'Lawlor (1768–1850) the Spanish general and military Governor of Granada.

In addition to the operation of local, virtual instances, UCS can also be operated in cloud environments. Via the integration of the open source software Samba 4, Univention also supports the functions provided in many companies by Microsoft Active Directory for the administration of computers operated with Microsoft Windows. UCS-based components and UCS-certified, third party products can be installed via the Univention App Center. UCS provides all App Center applications with a runtime environment and services for the operation including a central, consistent management of the apps. Docker containers can also be run on UCS systems and several of the apps available in the App Center are Docker-based. Univention is a member of the Open Source Business Alliance and supports the creation of the Open Source Business Alliance open source software stacks.  History  The impulse for the development of UCS, which began in 2002, was the lack of a standardised Linux server operating system offering companies and organisations an alternative to Microsoft’s domain concept with the proprietary directory service Active Directory. Comparable Linux solutions (e.g., from SUSE and Red Hat) did not offer an integrated, cross-system user and computer management system, with the result that corresponding solutions had to be configured and maintained individually. Important early driving forces for the development of UCS were initially the Oldenburgische Landesbank and the department of the Bremen Senator for Education and Science, until the product was ready for market launch at the end of 2004. Since then, in addition to new versions, a number of software solutions based on the main product UCS have also been launched. UCS is predominantly employed in the German-speaking world by companies and public organisations from a wide range of sectors and fields, among others by the regional government authority of the federal state Brandenburg. In 2005, Univention began to market UCS also in other German-speaking countries. Today, UCS is used in many European countries and also outside of Europe, for example, in Australia, Nigeria and the USA where Univention established a subsidiary in 2013.  Licenses and Editions  UCS is open-source software; the proprietary developments of Univention GmbH included in UCS were published under the GNU GPL until Version 2.3. With the launch of Version 2.4, the company switched to GNU AGPL. There are also a range of software appliances based on UCS (e.g., in the groupware, desktop and IT service management fields). Since April 21, 2015 UCS is freely available to companies in form of the UCS Core Edition, which replaced the previous \\"free for personal use\\" license. This Core Edition is a fully featured version and differs from the fee-based edition only in terms of product liability and support.  Structure and components  Univention Corporate Server is based on the Linux distribution Debian GNU/Linux. There are numerous open source applications integrated in UCS, for example Samba, the authentication service Kerberos, the virtualization software KVM, and Nagios for the monitoring of servers. The core and important unique selling point of UCS is the central administration tool \\"Univention Management Console\\", which allows the cross-system and cross- location management of IT infrastructures. UCS uses the directory service OpenLDAP to save data for identity and system management. The administration tools are operated via the web-based applications and command-line interfaces. Thanks to the integrated administration service UCS Virtual Machine Manager (UVMM), the administration tools also allow the central administration of virtualized servers and clients, hard drives, CDROM and DVD images as well as the physical systems on which they are operated. The manufacturer goes to great lengths to guarantee possibilities for the integration of UCS in existing IT environments via the use of open standards and supplied connectors. In this way, the integrated tool Active Directory Connection allows the bidirectional synchronisation of the Microsoft directory service Active Directory and the directory service used in UCS, OpenLDAP. In addition, UCS offers various interfaces for manufacturers of application software enabling them to integrate their applications in the UCS management system. Since UCS 3.1, UCS provides with \\"Univention App Center\\" an own graphic management component for the installation and deinstallation of UCS components and UCS-certified third-party appliances. The Univention App Center includes, beside Univention solutions, for example, the Open Source groupware solutions Kopano, Open-Xchange, the document management system agorum core, the slack alternative Rocket.Chat and the dropbox alternatives ownCloud and Nextcloud, or the collaboration solutions ONLYOFFICE and Collabora.

Built in 1939 with Works Progress Administration funding, the auditorium is one of several buildings in the area in a similar style, known as WPA Moderne. It was designed by architect Robert Stanton of Carmel, in partnership with Joseph Jacinto Mora, who designed and executed the building's extensive sculptural elements. Description The King City High School Auditorium is executed in cast-in-place concrete. The design makes full use of concrete's potential for plastic form, with compound curves, rounded corners and cast-in sculptural forms. The structure is somewhat elliptical in plan, with rounded corners. A projecting rounded bay at the front comprises the main entrance, with three pairs of doors separated by tall fluted pilasters surmounted by cast busts of Comedy and Tragedy, dividing a triptych relief sculpture that is itself divided into three levels. The ends of the facade curve around to the side elevations, which have inset fluted panels whose pilasters are crowned with more cast sculpture derived from characters from A Midsummer Night's Dream. The rear elevation is comparatively plain and utilitarian. The lobby is detailed with bright blue wainscoting and ceilings. Curved stairs give access to the balcony on either side of the lobby, with six doors into the main house. Floors throughout are covered in cork, as well as in the aisles of the auditorium. The auditorium seats 596 in the orchestra section and 387 in the balcony. The proscenium surrounding the stage features Mora reliefs and concave fluted pilasters.

It is not funded by NHS Wales, but only by charitable donations. It also provides the Children's Air Ambulance Wales emergency transfer service. The charity aims to save lives and reduce or prevent disability or suffering from critical illness and injury, by delivering a pre-hospital emergency medical service. EC135, was used by the Wales Air Ambulance prior the introduction of the H145 aircraft, but has since returned to be used as the Children's Air Ambulance Wales. Service The service has four helicopters and medical crews stationed at Caernarfon Airport, Welshpool Airport, Llanelli and Cardiff Heliport. The team are capable of reaching a critically ill patient anywhere in Wales within 20minutes of receiving a call. Each helicopter team consists of a pilot and two medics, typically a doctor and critical care practitioner, or two critical care practitioners. The Children's Air Ambulance Wales operates from Cardiff, taking children on urgent inter- hospital transfers to specialist paediatric and neonatal hospitals in the UK including Alder Hey and Great Ormond Street. The charity's critical care practitioners - nurses and paramedics - and doctors are seconded from EMRTS Cymru. Pilots are provided by specialist emergency services helicopter company, Babcock Mission Critical Services Onshore. The specialist staff can provide a range of critical care interventions, previously only found in hospitals, at the roadside, reducing the time taken for lifesaving care to take place. This includes giving a general anaesthetic to patients, providing sedation for painful procedures and undertaking critical surgical procedures. All vehicle platforms carry a range of equipment to facilitate this including monitoring, high level portable ventilator and specialist transfer equipment. More recently, the service has commenced carrying blood products. This includes red blood cells for transfusion to bleeding patients, as well as freeze-dried plasma and fibrinogen to help with clotting and monitors and drugs to help reverse bleeding in patients who are on blood thinning medicine (warfarin) in an emergency situation. Fleet Three of the aircraft operating for the charity are Airbus Helicopters H145. Llanelli-based aircraft (G-WENU) has callsign Helimed 57, Welshpool (G-WOBR) is Helimed 59, while the Caernarfon-based aircraft (G-WORL) has callsign Helimed 61. There is also a Eurocopter EC135 based in Cardiff as the Children's Air Ambulance. This aircraft is staffed by two pilots and a specialist Helicopter Transfer Practitioner, or HTP (nurse, paramedic or ODP with additional training in critical care and transfer medicine). The service also works with local neonatal and paediatric specialist retrieval teams who join the crew when appropriate. This EC135 aircraft, G-WASC, callsign Helimed 67, has specialist equipment and can be fitted with purpose designed equipment for transfer of young children and neonates, including a transport incubator. All helicopters are owned by Babcock Mission Critical Services Onshore, who also provide the pilots, base engineers and maintenance for the aircraft. The three H145 aircraft are equipped for night-vision goggle (NVG) operations and have additional lighting fitted for operation in darkness. At present the aircraft operate (weather dependent) from 08:00 to 20:00, seven days a week. In addition to the four aircraft, the charity runs five rapid response road vehicles (RRV), spread across its four bases. These are adapted Audi Q7 with full audio and visual warning systems that carry the same standard equipment as the aircraft, and are utilised if the aircraft is offline, for example due to weather conditions, or as an additional responding resource.

Complementing the Indian national programme, we build capacity, provide technical support and advocate to strengthen the delivery of effective, innovative, community-based HIV programmes to vulnerable populations: sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, hijras, people who inject drugs (PWID), and people living with HIV. Alliance India's programmes foster wellbeing, realise equality, and affirm the dignity of communities most affected by HIV/AIDS. Leveraging its implementation experience, it works closely with the Alliance Regional Technical Support Hub for South AsiaSouth Asia Hub Official Website to strengthen capacity of civil society organisations, government and the private sector in South Asia to respond more effectively to HIV/AIDS. An independent national NGO managed and governed wholly in India, Alliance India is also an accredited member of the global network of Linking Organisations of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance. Technical Priorities Alliance India works in the following technical areas of the HIV response in India: * HIV Prevention * Care and Support * HIV and SRH * Harm Reduction and Drug use Current Programmes Vihaan Named for the Sanskrit word for ‘dawn’s first light,’ Vihaan is a national initiative establishing and managing 350 Care & Support Centres (CSCs) across India to expand access to essential services, increase treatment adherence, reduce stigma and discrimination, and improve the quality of life of people living with HIV (PLHIV). The programme is designed as the care & support component of the country's HIV response under National AIDS Control Programme IV (NACP IV). Working in collaboration with the Department of AIDS ControlDepartment of AIDS Control: India and with support from the Global Fund, the programme operates in 31 states and territories and will reach more than one million PLHIV by 2016. The Vihaan consortium is led by Alliance India and 17 state-level PLHIV networks and NGOs that in turn partner with district-level PLHIV networks and other organisations to deliver care & support services in communities. Vihaan provides access to a range of quality care & support services using an integrated approach that complements existing HIV prevention and treatment programming. Working in coordination with nearby ART Centres, CSCs serve as safe spaces for PLHIV offering services that include counselling, outreach and follow-up support, health referrals, and linkages to social welfare schemes. HRAsia (Harm Reduction Advocacy in Asia grant) People who inject drugs in Asia are disproportionately affected by HIV, despite the region seeing an overall decline in HIV rates. In 2018, UNAIDS reported HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs in Southeast Asia to be highest in the Philippines (29%), Indonesia (28.76%), and Thailand (19.02%). Access to combination prevention services, especially Harm Reduction, remains a challenge in a few countries according to survey data from 2016–2018. The Global Fund’s Harm Reduction Advocacy in Asia grant (HRAsia) is based on learning from the earlier national programme. Since 2017, the regional grant focuses on advocacy to achieve the long-term sustainability of harm reduction interventions in line with the 90-90-90 targets in seven high priority countries of Asia through our country partners in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Our technical partners under the regional grant are the International Drug Policy Consortium, a global network of 182 NGOs, Asian Network of People who Use Drugs, the regional community-led organization and Harm Reduction International, a leading NGO dedicated to reducing the negative health, social and legal impacts of drug use and drug policy. Samarth In implementation since 2016 with support from Elton John AIDS Foundation, Samarth, (meaning competent) project provides community-led HIV screening and treatment linkages for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender and hijra (TGH) population by ensuring confidential and sensitive dealing of various sexual health- related issues. Samarth community clinics are implemented through a consortium of five partners, Lakshya Trust, Sangama Trust, Amitie Trust, Udaan Trust and Shaan Foundation in seven cities: Noida (Delhi NCR), Jalandhar (Punjab), Vadodara (Gujarat), Hyderabad (Telangana), Hooghly (West Bengal), Hassan (Karnataka) and Pune (Maharashtra). Samarth is the first community-based testing intervention implemented in India with the support of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) for MSM and TGH population. The project works closely with NACO & State AIDS Control Societies. The project has helped the national programme to gather higher reactivity among MSM & TGH person, reach out to the new population, not yet served under targeted interventions, for prevention services and to increase health-seeking behaviour among them. Sampoorna Sampoorna (meaning ‘Holistic’ or “Complete” in Hindi) Project is implemented in nine priority districts of Gujarat (Ahmedabad, Surat, Sabarkatha, Banaskatha, Vadodara, Chota Udaipur, Aravali, Kheda and Anand) focusing on creating viable ecosystems to strengthen HIV–SRH at service delivery and community level. Supported by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the project was rolled out in April 2020 for the project cycle 2020-2022. In the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, the project has included COVID-19 response to address the access gaps in ART medications and reproductive health products along with mental health counselling for PLHIV and high-risk groups. The field staff include outreach workers of Care and Support Centres ( CSCs), Targeted Interventions ( TIs), Link Workers Scheme ( LWS), frontline workers of National Health Mission – ASHA and ANM. A number of studies have generated evidence indicating that SRH and HIV issues are intertwined. However, both these programmes work in parallel without concrete collaborations. While we are aiming towards ambitious targets of SDGs to be achieved till 2030, we need to bridge the gaps between SRH & HIV and work towards integrated training, service provision and counselling for holistic (Sampoorna) health response to our communities. This will improve access to information and risk perception, improve continuity of care, and reduce the cost of services and would also lead to improved client-health worker relationships. Moreover, SRH needs of the key population – women in sex work (WISW) and transgender (TGs) seeking reproductive and sexual services are not met due to lack of enabling environment and specific services for them. The project will demonstrate stronger and sustainable SRH-HIV integration at medical colleges, 70 CHCs & PHCs and also at the state level. Larger advocacy framework of this programme will work towards mainstreaming issues related to stigma and discrimination, gender-based violence and community system strengthening. The key strategies will involve; evidence-based advocacy with State AIDS Control organization and NHM, capacity building of medical and paramedical staff with an integrated module on SRH-HIV and capacity building of frontline NHM health workers as well as HIV TI NGOs on delivery of integrated services. The project will also identify and empower community champions for the sustainability of the project. Furthermore, the district mentors will supervise and facilitate the continuation of essential SRH-HIV services among women, adolescents, key populations and PLHIV. Hridaya Named for the Hindi word for ‘heart,’ the Hridaya programme expands harm reduction services for people who inject drugs (PWID), their partners and families and fosters an enabling environment by protecting and promoting their rights. The programme leverages the existing government investment in HIV prevention for PWID and builds NGO capacity to expand services to include a full range of harm reduction interventions. Hridaya is funded by the Government of Netherlands and is part of the five- country Community Action on Harm ReductionCommunity Action on Harm Reduction initiative. The programme in India complements and supplements the services of Targeted Interventions (TIs) in selected states. TIs are at the centre of the HIV prevention approach for PWID adopted by the Department of AIDS Control and implemented by State AIDS Control Societies (SACS) around the country. Hridaya works in partnership with 34 organisations to augment existing capacity and fill implementation gaps in harm reduction in the states of Bihar, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Jammu, and Manipur. By the end of 2014, the programme will reach more than 50,000 beneficiaries, including more than 10,000 PWID. Past Programmes WINGS Alliance India piloted WINGS, an intervention model for addressing gender-based violence (GBV) and intimate partner violence (IPV) against women using drugs (WUDs), in 2017 with support from Frontline AIDS. As a successful model, Alliance India is currently implementing the third phase of WINGS intervention from June to December 2019 in partnership with Sahara Aalhad in Pune, Ganga Social Foundation in Delhi and Nirvana Foundation in Manipur. WINGS is an evidence-based screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment service tool designed to identify the intimate partner violence and gender-based violence for women who use drugs. The intervention enables participating women to develop safety planning strategies and strengthen their social support networks. WINGS can be delivered in one to two sessions and has been integrated with HIV counselling and testing and linkage to HIV treatment interventions. LINKAGES Building on the years of experience of closely working with HRG communities on HIV prevention, treatment and care, Alliance India directly implemented LINKAGES project supported by FHI 360 funded by USAIDS PEPFAR in six high burden districts of Maharashtra (Mumbai, Pune and Thane) and Andhra Pradesh (Krishna, Guntur and East Godavari) starting from August 2017. For the first time, an HIV programme was designed to provide HIV services to the scattered MSM and TG population in remote sub-districts of rural districts. As an attempt to reduce structural barriers, the Linkages project collaborated with 16 community-based organisations and 77 targeted interventions of State AIDS Control Organisations. The staff serving female sex workers and MSM and TGs were trained on gender-based violence and violence mitigation, laws and policies that can harm or help the community and supported in advocacy activities with the stakeholders. On the other hand, had a series of sensitization meetings and training with health care providers which lead to increased service uptake. To ensure that communities continue to serve beyond the project period, efforts were put in strengthening the institution and organisational development for community-based organisations in the two states. Chanura Kol Often neglected, women who inject drugs are a highly marginalised and vulnerable population in need of a comprehensive response to meet their health and social needs. With support from the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Alliance India partnered with Social Awareness Social Organisation to mitigate the impact of drug use and HIV on these women through the Chanura Kol project – named with the Manipuri words for ‘garden of women.’ Through a holistic, community-based model, Chanura Kol met immediate health, protection and psychosocial needs of women who inject drugs. In addition the project enhanced access to harm reduction services, supported economic rehabilitation and social integration, and reduced stigma and discrimination related to both injecting drug use and HIV. Drop-in centres and a short-stay home were established to provide harm reduction services, HIV prevention interventions, care & support programming, and counselling. Support groups were also formed in each district, providing outreach and referrals to sexual & reproductive health (SRH), antiretroviral therapy (ART), ICTC, general health and other social services. Referrals were also provided for drug treatment and oral substitution therapy (OST). Once women completed treatment or stabilised on OST, they could access the short-stay home for six months; the home provided shelter, food, health services, psychosocial and family reintegration support, and vocational training. Avahan Avahan India AIDS Initiative was a focused prevention initiative funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that worked in six states of India to reduce HIV transmission and lower the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections in vulnerable high-risk populations – female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, people who inject drugs (PWID) – through prevention education and services. Alliance India was designated a state lead partner for Avahan in Andhra Pradesh (AP). The programme's main components included condom promotion, STI management, behaviour change communication, community mobilisation, and advocacy. Avahan also supported the creation of an enabling environment through individual and organisational capacity building to increase the effectiveness and impact of the HIV response. Alliance India's efforts in Andhra Pradesh strengthened the capacity of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and community-based organisation (CBOs) to implement quality HIV and STI programming in close partnership with the AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS)APSACS Official Website and in alignment with the National AIDS Control Programme IV (NACP IV). Reaching more than 85,000 FSWs, MSM and transgender people, the programme contributed significantly to HIV prevention among high-risk population in Andhra Pradesh. Health-seeking behaviour in these groups increased from 5% to 70% in the first five years of the programme. Condom distribution increased from 6.5 million to 102 million in six years. An estimated 10,000 HIV infections were averted among target populations in the 13 intervention districts in the Telangana and Rayalseema regions, and more than 450,000 people were reached through prevention campaigns and public events. Koshish Named for the Hindi word for ‘effort,’ the Koshish programme supported advocacy and action to improve sexual & reproductive health (SRH) of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and key populations in India. Funded by the European Union, the programme strengthened civil society organisations and networks that represent and work with PLHIV and other marginalised groups, such as female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, hijras and people who inject drugs (PWID). Through coalitions, Koshish partner organisations worked at state and district levels, affirming principles of empowerment and meaningful partnership as core elements of effective advocacy. The programme was successful in advancing community-led advocacy initiatives that raised awareness of SRH challenges faced by PLHIV. Community priorities were then taken up by state-level advocacy coalitions established by Koshish and composed of civil society organisations, PLHIV networks, community-based organisations working for and led by key populations, and media. Koshish successfully advocated for appropriate interventions to address critical challenges facing PLHIV, including social stigma and discrimination, limited accessibility to and availability of essential SRH services, and lack of a comprehensive approach to the SRH needs of PLHIV, particularly of women living with HIV (WLHIV). For instance, the programme increased access for WLHIV in the four programme states to Pap smear testing. WLHIV are five-times more susceptible to cervical cancer than other women. Alliance India implemented Koshish in partnership with CHETNA, MAMTA, PWDS and VMM, along with state- level PLHIV networks in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Abhaya Female sex workers (FSWs) have considerable unmet sexual & reproductive health (SRH) needs due to their occupations and social marginalization. They are discouraged from accessing SRH services due to stigma and discrimination, negative attitudes of healthcare providers, and fear of clients, law enforcement, and people opposed to sex work. Evidence, both global and national, has shown that linking HIV and SRH services provide a valuable impetus to encourage uptake of prevention, treatment, and care and support services, especially by people living with HIV (PLHIV) and key populations, including FSWs. With this approach in mind, Alliance India with funding support from MAC AIDS Fund has initiated a pilot programme Abhaya – meaning ‘fearless woman’ in Hindi – for FSWs in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. Abhaya expands access to complementary SRH services, including basic information, counselling, referrals and linkages to facilities providing required services. In addition, Abhaya builds the capacity of healthcare providers to address the specific needs of FSWs. Abhaya also engages in advocacy with the government to identify opportunities to adapt and scale up expanded access to SRH services for FSWs. Abhaya gives a significant role to FSWs in the implementation of the programme at all stages to increase ownership and the potential for sustainability of the initiative. Over the first two pilot years, the programme will reach 4,500 FSWs and their partners, helping them better identify their SRH needs and access quality services thus empowering them to protect their overall health and well-being. Pehchan Named for the Hindi word meaning ‘identity,’ ‘recognition’ or ‘acknowledgement,’ the Pehchan programme strengthens and builds the capacity of 200 community-based organisations (CBOs) to provide effective, inclusive and sustainable HIV prevention programming in 17 states in India for more than 450,000 men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people and hijras (collectively, MTH). Pehchan is funded by the Global Fund and remains their largest single-country grant to date focused on the HIV response for vulnerable and underserved sexual minorities. Along with Alliance India, the Pehchan consortium includes the Humsafar Trust, Pehchan North Region Office, SAATHII, Sangama, Alliance India Andhra Pradesh, and SIAAP. Pehchan is a rare example of a Community Systems Strengthening programme working at a national scale. It provides organisational development, technical and capacity building support to new and existing CBOs working with MTH communities. Using a rights-based approach, the programme develops CBOs to serve as implementing partners with the National AIDS Control Programme's Targeted Interventions (TIs) that provide HIV prevention services to high-risk groups. By helping build strong CBOs, Pehchan addresses capacity gaps that often prevent them from receiving government funding. Pehchan also enhances the scope of services to reflect the needs of the community. The programme leverages and complements the government's HIV prevention strategy for MTH by providing services beyond basic HIV prevention that support an enabling environment that encourages healthy behaviours. Pehchan also fosters community-friendly services in the broader health system and engages in advocacy to improve the lives and wellbeing of MTH populations in India. =Action Project= In a region where taboos prevent open discussions about sex, the Action Project opened up spaces for such conversations among young people in India and Bangladesh. Funded by the European Union, the project supported community mobilisation and advocacy to improve sexual & reproductive health (SRH) of young people. Using a right- based approach, the project focused particularly on the most marginalised young people – men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, people who inject drugs (PWID), female sex workers (FSWs), and people living with HIV (PLHIV). Peer-led discussions strengthened and empowered civil society organisations and youth groups to advocate for more responsive policies addressing the SRH of young people. The Action Project was implemented in India by Alliance India in the states of Manipur and Uttar Pradesh in partnership with SASO and MAMTA and in Bangladesh by HASAB. One of the key strategies employed by the project was the development of Youth Partnership Platforms (YPPs) to link youth group networks together at various levels to advocate for the inclusion of young people and their issues in national and state-level SRH policy and programme development. In addition, the establishment of Youth Information Centres at village level increased SRH and HIV knowledge among participating youth and expanded their capacity to share this information with their peers and in the wider community. =CHAHA= Named for the Hindi word for ‘wish,’ CHAHA was India's first large-scale care & support programme for children, families and communities affected by HIV/AIDS. With support from the Global Fund, the programme was implemented in four states – Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, and Tamil Nadu – by Alliance India in collaboration with LEPRA, MAMTA, PWDS, SASO, VMM, NMP+, Plan India, TASOSS, and 54 community partner organisations. CHAHA was a child- centered, community-based care & support programme aimed at reducing HIV- related morbidity and mortality among children and adults by increasing social protection and enabling stigma-free access to services. Over the life of the programme, CHAHA reached 64,056 children and their families in 41,974 households affected by HIV. In its initial design, the programme focused on providing direct services. Based on lessons learnt through implementation, CHAHA revised its approach to focus on linking beneficiaries with existing government-funded social welfare schemes. Campaigns =207 against 377= Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) criminalizes sexual activities \\"against the order of nature\\", including all homosexual acts. Initiated by the Pehchan programme,Alliance India: Pehchan Programme the ‘207 against 377’ campaign protests the December 2013 Supreme Court judgment that upheld Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, overturning a 2009 Delhi High Court judgment and thus re-criminalizing homosexuality. The decision contemptuously referred to sexual minorities as a \\"miniscule minority\\" whose rights are \\"so-called.\\" The ruling has made members of India's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities even more vulnerable to violations of their basic human rights, including discrimination, harassment and violence. Almost immediately, the Pehchan partners saw an impact on its work with men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people and hijras, as fewer community members sought services as a consequence of the judgment. ‘207 against 377’207 against 377 brings together the 207 organisations implementing Pehchan on a common platform to undertake advocacy against the judgment at district, state and national levels. The campaign reaches out to various stakeholders including political parties, religious leaders, media, police and educational institutions to increase their understanding of the challenges facing LGBT communities. The initiative raises awareness to influence the ongoing legal process to ensure rights, protection and dignity for all LGBT Indians.

She wants to become a singer like Lola herself someday, although parents Mary Ann (Una Merkel) and John Crabtree (James Barton), who run a boarding house, don't necessarily approve. Lotta has a couple of admirers, the local boy Mart Taylor (Dennis Day) and a mature newcomer to town, Tom Richmond (Dale Robertson), who is informed that Lotta is only 16. A boarder named Cornelius (Raymond Walburn) with a surefire way to win at roulette lures Lotta's dad into a game, where he loses all of his money plus the boarding house. Aware of the way Lola Montez made a fortune singing in mining camps for men who can't get to a theater, Lotta sets out on the road to do likewise. The miners like her, but don't throw gold pieces her way until she strips off part of her costume and gives them quite a show. Lotta's father wins a San Francisco theater in a card game.

The play is influenced by the Spanish civil war and portrays the difficult relationship between men who wanted to fight, and their mothers and loved ones who did not want them to go. It also shows the fight against fascism, and the emotional turmoil and suffering that war brings. The play emphasizes the unnecessary difficulties of war and the complex relationships during war, emphasizing that although wars are bad, sometimes we have no choice but to fight them to protect our freedoms.Milo Urban translation 1968 of Matka The Play Heavily influenced by the Spanish Civil War, the play portrays Dolores, a mother and a wife, and her feelings as she slowly loses her husband and sons to war. The entire play is set in the house living room, which is full of ornamental pieces of war such as sabers, pistols, rifles, and monuments of colonial expeditions such as spears and shields, more closely resembling a museum than a family living room. The mother, Dolores, can communicate with her dead husband Richard, who died in what she considered a pointless battle against the natives in distant Africa, along with her son Ondra. Dolores talks with Richard the moment he dies, and Richard attempts to justify his death and insists he died in honor and duty, and in turn Dolores complains about his leaving of her and her five children. Suddenly after the communication, Andrew the oldest son and physician appears in the room (also dead) and tells his mother that he had lost his life in Africa attempting to cure yellow fever, and apologizes for his death in the progress of medicine. Her son George then appears in the room (dead) and greets his father and brothers to tell his desperate mother that he had died attempting to break the altitude record. At this moment, the news on the radio announce that the civil war in the country is growing more intense. Her sons Peter and Kornel are actively participating in this war, and later on, the two of them suddenly appear in the room to announce that both of then had died. Peter had died when he was arrested and executed by the Whites (White Terror), and Kornel was shot during a street battle.

He served as the Minister of Economy of Macedonia.http://www.osservatorioitaliano.org/read.php?id=99789 He took the office of a Minister of Economy in July 2011, setting as priorities in his mandate the improvement of the business climate, increasing competitiveness of Macedonian economy, development of an efficient and stable energy system, planned and sustainable utilization of mineral resources and development of tourism. Political career =Minister of Economy= Proponent for economic integration of the region, with the aim of increased investments, strengthened economic cooperation, joint approach on third markets and creation of regional tourism package that would meet the requirements of the world tourist. At his initiative are intensified the activities in the field of mineral resources and the procedure for awarding concessions for exploration and exploitation are accelerated. Support of entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises is implemented through numerous activities and program measures, and for the first time are stimulated the women’s entrepreneurship and crafts, as special segments of entrepreneurship. Communication with business entities and its associations is continuous with meetings, working meetings, visits of business capacities and participation at public debates. As a representative of the Democratic Union for Integration, which on July 1, 2008 made coalition with VMRO-DPMNE, Minister Saraqini implemented series of activities and investment projects directed to the places where mostly Albanian population lives, especially in Western Macedonia. Beside the procedure for finding a strategic investor-concessionaire of the TIDZ Tetovo, series of investments were implemented in projects in the energy field, especially in the part of concessions for small hydro-power plants and activities for improving energy efficiency in schools and kindergartens. In the field of tourism, the Ohrid- Struga coast was put on the map of the tour operators, especially the Benelux countries, but also Turkey, eastern countries and the Balkans, and are also intensified the activities for modernization of the winter center Popova Shapka. Series of measures were implemented in direction of improving the business climate, which had a special influence on mitigating the consequences of the global economic crisis, and as a result of some of the implemented activities Republic of Macedonia, according to Doing Business 2012, is ranked on the sixth place in the world and the first in Europe for the speed of registration of a company. Namely, registration of trading company takes 40 hours and costs about 30 EUR, due to which it may be said that RM has the fastest, cheapest and most efficient/easiest registration in Europe and one of the best in the world. =International activities= In direction of promoting regional cooperation Minister Saraqini had visits and meetings with the Minister of Economy of Republic of Albania, Насип Начо, the Deputy Prime minister and Minister of Trade of Republic of Kosovo Mimoza Kusari Lila and Minister of Economy of Republic of Kosovo, Besim Beqaj, the Minister of Economy of Republic of Turkey, Zafer Caglayan, Minister of Economy of Republic of Serbia Nebosja Kirik, Minister of Economy of Republic of Bulgaria, Trajco Traykov. Saraqini was head of the delegation at the first meeting of the Joint Committee for the Free Trade Agreement between Macedonia and Kosovo, as well as of a business delegation of about 50 business entities, at the Kosovo- Macedonian Business Forum in Pristine and as member of the Government delegation, he participated at the Investment Forum in Great Britain, within the Road Show that was held in London and the Road Show held in Republic of Turkey. He realized meeting with a high ranking delegation from PR China, which came to an official visit to Republic of Macedonia, at which were presented the possibilities for promotion and extension of the economic cooperation, as well as a meeting the Mexican telecommunication magnate Carlos Slim, as member of the Government team, during his visit to Republic of Macedonia, and within the Chairing role of Slim at the meeting of the Broad bend and Digital Development Commission in Ohrid.

They can be seen as a counterpart to the rather well-known family of optical metamaterials. They are often also termed elastodynamic metamaterials and include acoustic metamaterials as a special case of vanishing shear. Their mechanical properties can be designed to have values which cannot be found in nature.  Examples of mechanical metamaterials  = Acoustic / phononic metamaterials = Acoustic or phononic metamaterials can exhibit acoustic properties not found in nature, such as negative effective bulk modulus, negative effective mass density, or double negativity. They find use in (mostly still purely scientific) applications like acoustic subwavelength imaging, superlensing, negative refraction or transformation acoustics. = Materials with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics) = Poisson's ratio defines how a material expands (or contracts) transversely when being compressed longitudinally. While most natural materials have a positive Poisson's ratio (coinciding with our intuitive idea that by compressing a material it must expand in the orthogonal direction), a family of extreme materials known as auxetic materials can exhibit Poisson's ratios below zero. Examples of these can be found in nature, or fabricated, and often consist of a low-volume microstructure that grants the extreme properties to the bulk material. Simple designs of composites possessing negative Poisson's ratio (inverted hexagonal periodicity cell) were published in 1985. In addition, certain origami folds such as the Miura fold and, in general, zigzag-based folds are also known to exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. = Metamaterials with negative longitudinal and volume compressibility transitions = In a closed thermodynamic system in equilibrium, both the longitudinal and volumetric compressibility are necessarily non-negative because of stability constraints. For this reason, when tensioned, ordinary materials expand along the direction of the applied force. It has been shown, however, that metamaterials can be designed to exhibit negative compressibility transitions, during which the material undergoes contraction when tensioned (or expansion when pressured). When subjected to isotropic stresses, these metamaterials also exhibit negative volumetric compressibility transitions. In this class of metamaterials, the negative response is along the direction of the applied force, which distinguishes these materials from those that exhibit negative transversal response (such as in the study of negative Poisson's ratio). = Pentamode metamaterials or meta-fluids = SEM image of a pentamode metamaterial (with a size of roughly 300μm) A pentamode metamaterial is an artificial three- dimensional structure which, despite being a solid, ideally behaves like a fluid. Thus, it has a finite bulk but vanishing shear modulus, or in other words it is hard to compress yet easy to deform. Speaking in a more mathematical way, pentamode metamaterials have an elasticity tensor with only one non-zero eigenvalue and five (penta) vanishing eigenvalues. Pentamode structures have been proposed theoretically by Graeme Milton and Andrej Cherkaev in 1995 but have not been fabricated until early 2012. According to theory, pentamode metamaterials can be used as the building blocks for materials with completely arbitrary elastic properties. Anisotropic versions of pentamode structures are a candidate for transformation elastodynamics and elastodynamic cloaking. = Cosserat and Micropolar Metamaterials = Very often Cauchy elasticity is sufficient to describe the effective behavior of mechanical metamaterials. When the unit cells of typical metamaterials are not centrosymmetric it has been shown that an effective description using chiral micropolar elasticity (or Cosserat ) was required. Micropolar elasticity combines the coupling of translational and rotational degrees of freedom in the static case and shows an equivalent behavior to the optical activity. = Willis materials = In 2006 Milton, Briane and Willis showed that the correct invariant form of linear elastodynamics is the local set of equations originally proposed by Willis in the late 1970s and early 1980s, to describe the elastodynamics of inhomogeneous materials. This includes the apparently unusual (in elastic materials) coupling between stress, strain and velocity and also between momentum, strain and velocity. Invariance of Navier's equations can occur under the transformation theory, but would required materials with non-symmetric stress, hence the interest in Cosserat materials noted above. The theory was given further foundations in the paper by Norris and Shuvalov. = Hyperelastic cloaking and invariance = Another mechanism to achieve non-symmetric stress is to employ pre-stressed hyperelastic materials and the theory of \\"small on large\\", i.e. elastic wave propagation through pre-stressed nonlinear media. Two papers written in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A in 2012 established this principal of so-called hyperelastic cloaking and invariance and have been employed in numerous ways since then in association with elastic wave cloaking and phononic media.

Designed by Stelio Frati, it was a single-engine version of his earlier twin-engined Airone. Only one was built. Design and development The F.9 Sparviero was a single-engined version of the earlier, twin-engined F.6 Airone, both Stelio Frati designs. The two aircraft shared many constructional details and had almost the same dimensions and weights, though the Sparviero's nose-mounted engine extended the fuselage. Engine layout apart, the two were very similar in appearance; they also both failed to reach production and only one Airone and one Sparviero were built. The Sparviero had an all-wood, low mounted cantilever wing of isosceles trapezoidal plan, built around a single spar and covered with stressed plywood skin, with differential ailerons and trailing edge flaps. The fuselage was a ply skinned wooden monocoque, built in two sections which bolted together just aft of the wings. The forward part held the cabin, which seated four in two pairs, with access via two wide doors over the wings. The roof line of the cabin continued aft into that of the rear fuselage. The Sparviero was initially powered by a 250 hp (187 kW) Hirth inverted V-8 air-cooled engine, though it was the intention to replace this with a 260 hp (194 kW) Lycoming horizontally opposed engine in production models and the prototype received one later. Fuel was fed from three tanks, two in the wings and one in the fuselage. The tail unit was conventional, with the tailplane just above the fuselage. The latter tapered in height rearwards, and the fin merged into it with a dorsal fillet. The empennage construction was similar to that of the wing, except that the control surfaces were fabric-covered. The tricycle undercarriage was retractable and fitted with hydraulic brakes. The Sparviero first flew on 27 July 1956, piloted by Vico Rocaspina who was responsible for all the early flight programme. Operational history The only Sparviero built, I-HAWK, was in private hands by April 1958, based at Milano Linate and was still there in July 1964.

Later that year they became the resident group at The Ancient Foresters pub in Bermondsey, and they also started to play at Dan Farson's pub, The Waterman's Arms, on the Isle of Dogs in London's East End.Daily Mirror 2 June 1964 Having already built up a good reputation and following locally, the group were booked to appear at the South London Beat Show on 24 November 1963 at Lewisham Town Hall, Catford, where they were on the bill together with the Cougars, Pete Budd & the Rebels and the Konrads, who included David Bowie in their line- up.Kevin Cann (2010) Any Day Now – David Bowie – The London Years: 1947–1974 After becoming the group's manager, Dan Farson decided that in future they would be called \\"Karl King & The Vendettas\\". He thought that two \\"Ks\\" in Carl's name would be an eye catcher. In January and February 1964, he booked the group to play six days a week in \\"Nights at the Comedy\\", a variety show which he devised and staged at The Comedy Theatre in London's West End. Around early 1964 they recorded two singles for Decca Records which were never released. =The Druids= In September 1964, King started to rehearse with the Druids. He did his first gig with the Druids in early October 1964 and was lead singer until the group finally split up in September 1965. =The Meaning= After the Druids split up in September 1965, King joined a group called the Meaning, who were based around Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. The Meaning were booked to play at a number of weekend shows held by Radio London at the Wimbledon Palais, and in May they paid for a session at Oak Studios in Morden, where they recorded cover versions of Barbara Lewis' \\"Hello Stranger\\" and The Temptations' \\"I Wanna Love I Can See\\", which were never released but the latter can now be found on YouTube. =Recordings CBS 1966–67= In the meantime, The Meaning's demo record had begun to circulate and found its way to Des Champ at CBS Records in London. After a short audition in the late summer of 1966, CBS offered King a recording contract for three single releases. The first single included two new songs written by well-established songwriters. A ballad called \\"Keep It Coming\\", written by American Laurence Weiss, and a blues-rock number, \\"Out of my Depth\\", by the British duo of Billy Martin and Phil Coulter. \\"Keep It Coming\\" was chosen as the A-side (CBS 202407 – released November 1966). In recent years, however, \\"Out of my Depth\\" has become a minor cult item and has been re-released on several compilation albums.Album: Mix a Fix – UK Floor Killers Vol. 2, 2007 The first single received positive reviews in the record press, but it failed to get many airplays NME 18 November 1966Record Retailer 17 November 1966 The A-side of King's second single was \\"You and Me\\" (written by Farrell, Adams & Kusik) with a cover of Duke Ellington's \\"Satin Doll\\" as the B-side (CBS 202553 – released February 1967).Now available on Hide and Seek – A Collection of British Blue- Eyed Soul 1964–69, 2007 Although it got some decent reviewsRecord Mirror 18 February 1967 it did not make any commercial inroads. =Carl King Projection= To promote the second single, King formed a backing band called the Projection with whom he played a series of gigs during February and March 1967, including Liverpool's Cavern Club on 12 February 1967.Phil Thompson (2007) The Best of Cellars – The Story of the Cavern Club However, due to managerial disagreements and health problems things failed to work out. In April 1967, King pulled out completely and a third projected single was never recorded. After 1967 After quitting the music industry in the UK in 1967, King moved to Denmark in 1969. He now lives near Aabenraa, Denmark, and is a member of the local hobby band, Out of Time. The band played its first gig in April 1999. King released a limited edition single CD on 21 April 2012 for Record Store Day 2012. The first song, \\"The Starman (A teasing tribute to Bowie)\\" is dedicated to David Bowie, who started his career at the same time as King in South East London in the early 1960s.

It is now served by lines S1 and S 2 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station. Although the city of Höchst was incorporated in Frankfurt in 1928, the official name of the station from its opening in 1967 was Farbwerke Hoechst (\\"Hoechst dye works\\"), but since the closure of the dye works, the station has been renamed Frankfurt- Höchst Farbwerke. Location Before the current station was built, there had been a station called Farbwerke on the Königstein Railway, which had a pedestrian connection to the dye works over a long steel bridge, known as the Eiserner Steg (\\"Iron Bridge\\"), after a more famous pedestrian bridge in central Frankfurt. The dye works seen from Frankfurt-Höchst Farbwerke station The current station was built in 1967 at the northern gate of the Höchst Industrial Park (Industriepark Höchst) and in 1978 it was incorporated into the S-Bahn network. The new platform is only accessible via a pedestrian tunnel, which has three entrances: two public entrances on both sides of the street of Hoechster-Farben-Straße, on which the Industriepark Höchst Tor Nord (“Höchst Industrial Park North Gate”) bus stop is located, and a private entrance on the grounds of the industrial park. In addition to its use by employees of the Industrial Park the station also benefits from its proximity to the Centennial Hall (Jahrhunderthalle), which is used for concerts and conferences, and the Fraport Arena. The pushbutton signal box of Frankfurt- Hoechst station is also in the platform area. It is responsible for controlling signalling and points at the stations of Frankfurt-Höchst, Frankfurt-Sindlingen, Hattersheim (Main), Frankfurt-Zeilsheim and Kriftel. In the immediate vicinity of the station, north of the through tracks, there is a maintenance centre for passenger trains, including a washing facility. Architecture  Industrial Park south of Hoechster-Farben-Straße from the platform While the actual platform, which has remained virtually unchanged for 40 years, has little architectural merit, the two entrance buildings in Hoechster-Farben-Straße were temporarily listed in the heritage list of the state of Hesse. The access tunnel was recently remodelled and since then it has been under video surveillance.

Cunningham (born in Wolverhampton, England) is a British electronic musician, best known under the pseudonym Actress. His music has been released by a variety of different recording labels, which most prominently include Ninja Tune, Honest Jon's Records, and Werkdiscs, a label he co-founded in 2004. His 2010 album Splazsh was named the best album of the year by UK magazine The Wire. Biography Growing up, Cunningham was a talented footballer, signing and playing for West Bromwich Albion until suffering an injury which derailed his career as a promising young talent. Cunningham’s first introduction to music came through Matthew Parsons; Cunningham’s friend who had a basic music studio set up in his student accommodation. When Parsons went travelling, Cunningham purchased Parson’s studio equipment for £200. When he first began making music, Cunningham did not use a metronome, a technique which Cunningham says has contributed to how his ‘style developed’. To fund his place on one of the first degree courses in Recording Arts, Cunningham signed up for a grant programme run by the PFA (Professional Footballers Association). In 2004, Following his early experiences in music and his subsequent immersion into the London club scene, Actress founded the label Werk Discs (later spelt Werkdiscs from 2012). The label started as a club night and has gone on to discover and release music by widely-talked about artists such as Helena Hauff, disrupt, Zomby, and Cunningham’s own releases. During this early period of Cunningham’s career, he remixed various productions, write for the ‘seminal techno imprint Soma Records’ and ‘put out singles and EPs through Prime Numbers and Nonplus.’ =Releases= Cunningham's debut album, Hazyville, was released originally by Werk Discs on 28 November 2008, and later under both Ninja Tune and Werk Discs in January 2014. Pop Matters described it as a ‘clear winner’ and it was retrospectively described as one of 2008's 'most slept-on electronic releases' the album was the first of Cunningham’s discography to be originally released by Werk Discs in collaboration with Ninja Tune. Cunningham's second album Splazsh, released 8 June 2010, was placed on numerous publications' end-of-year lists, including Fact and Resident Advisor, placing 3rd and 4th respectively. On top of this, the album topped The Wire's \\"2010 Rewind\\" list. Additionally, the album was placed 91st on Pitchfork's \\"100 Best Albums of the Decade So Far\\". It was also his first album to be released by Honest Jon's, a British record label jointly founded by Damon Albarn as an offshoot of the Honest Jon’s Record shop. Actress later traveled to the Democratic Republic of The Congo alongside Albarn to record ‘Kinshasha One Two’, which was released a year later in 2011 as a benefit single for Oxfam’s work in Congo. In March 2012, shortly before the release of his next album, Cunningham performed alongside Koreless and Lapalux as part of a Tate Modern exhibition dedicated to the work of Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama. On 20 April 2012, two years after the release of Splazsh, R.I.P. was released. It was the second album of Cunningham’s to be released on the Honest Jon’s imprint. The album received 'Best New Album' from Pitchfork, and was placed third on The Wire's 2012 annual critics' poll. The album was notable for displaying a shift in the musical direction for Actress, and was described as almost feeling 'like another artist entirely' by Drowned In Sound, who also described it as 'the most fully realised, ambitious and rewarding project that Cunningham has yet put to record'. Following this, Actress participated in ‘Alternative Perceptions’ at Tate Modern, a collaboration with Matthew Herbert and several other artists such as Moiré, Purple Ferdinand, Kate Tempest and Knit the City. The event took place on 22 September 2012. Cunningham went on to collaborate with choreographer Eddie Peake and visual artist Nic Hamilton in August 2013 for a collaborative multimedia performance at St John-at-Hackney. Titled 'A Shared Cultural Memory', the piece was ‘a night of unique audio-visual experiences in direct response to the architecture and atmosphere of the Church.’ Many thought Ghettoville, Cunningham's third album, to be his last, due to the cryptic press-release preceding the release of the project, in which Actress described the album as a ‘black tinted conclusion of the Actress image’, and signed the message off with ‘R.I.P. Music 2014’. The album was released collaboratively by both Cunningham’s own label, Werkdiscs, and Ninjatune, and went on to reach number 20 on the Billboard Chart's ‘Top Dance/Electronic albums’. It has been described as sitting ‘at the point of convergence for all of electronic music’s most cutting-edge sounds, incorporating pieces of them all and feeling out the unexpected ways they synchronize.'Holzmann, Samuel (January 27, 2014). \\"Review: Actress - Ghettoville\\". ‘’PrettyMuchAmazing.com'. Retrieved 28 August 2019. For Cunningham’s live performances of the album, Cunningham commissioned artists such as Riyo Nemeth, William Stein, and Nic Hamilton to create visual interpretations of each of the album’s tracks. William Stein’s visual interpretation of the album would be utilized for the album’s artwork. On 14 April 2017 Actress released AZD, his fifth studio album, and his latest to date, to Universal Acclaim. The album was described by Thea Ballard, writing for pitchfork, as an album that explores 'Cunningham’s clubbiest and most avant-garde impulses, exploring language and Afrofuturism while maintaining a musicality that holds the listener close.' Resident Advisor opined that ‘Cunningham can once again produce mirage-like moment[s] of beauty like nobody else’. The album entered the UK album charts at number 45, reaching number 3 on the UK Electronic iTunes Album Chart, number 5 on the US Electronic iTunes Album Chart, and number 6 on the German Electronic iTunes Album Charts. In October 2017, Actress was invited by the British Arts Council to perform a multimedia interpretation of Reich’s ‘Different Trains’ to mark the 70th anniversary of Indian independence. Titled ‘Different trains 1947’, the performance was a collaborative piece between Actress, Jack Barnett (These New Puritans), Indian music producer Sandunes, percussionist Jivraj Singh and vocalist Priya Purushothaman, and filmmakers/artists Iain Forsyth & Jane Pollard, who performed a new audiovisual composition in response to the events of 1947. On 26 May 2018 Actress collaborated with the London Contemporary Orchestra, performing to a sold-out audience at the Barbican, London. In 2018, the recordings of this performance were compiled and released as an album titled ‘LAGEOS’, described by The Guardian as formulating 'a new sonic palette that is in equal measures intriguing and unsettling. On 15 May 2019 Actress performed a musical and artistic tribute to Karlheinz Stockhausen in a show named 'Sin (x)', performed at the Royal Festival Hall in London. On 16th July 2020 Actress released an album titled \\"88\\" on Bandcamp. The record was uploaded as a 49 minute single.

Order of wear The position of the Pro Patria Medal in the official order of precedence was revised three times after 1975, to accommodate the inclusion or institution of new decorations and medals. ;South African Defence Force until 26 April 1994: Korea Medal Pro Patria Medal Southern Africa Medal *Official SADF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Korea Medal. ** Succeeded by the Southern Africa Medal. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the South African Police Medal for Combating Terrorism. ** Succeeded by the South African Railways Police Medal for Combating Terrorism. ;South African National Defence Force from 27 April 1994: Korea Medal Pro Patria Medal General Service Medal (Venda) *Official SANDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Korea Medal of the Union of South Africa. ** Succeeded by the General Service Medal of the Republic of Venda. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the South African Police Medal for Combating Terrorism of the Republic of South Africa. ** Succeeded by the Bophuthatswana Police Medal for Combating Terrorism of the Republic of Bophuthatswana. The position of the Pro Patria Medal in the order of precedence remained unchanged, as it was on 27 April 1994, when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted in April 1996 for the two former non- statutory forces, the Azanian People's Liberation Army and Umkhonto we Sizwe, and again when a new series of military decorations and medals was instituted in South Africa on 27 April 2003. Description ;Obverse The Pro Patria Medal is an octagonal medallion, struck in bronze and gilded, to fit in a circle 38 millimetres in diameter and 3 millimetres thick at the centre, with a golden aloe emblem in the centre on a blue roundel, 22 millimetres in diameter. ;Reverse The pre-1994 South African Coat of Arms is on the reverse, with the medal number stamped underneath. Later version with fixed suspender ;Ribbon The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide, with a 3 millimetres wide orange band, a 1½ millimetres wide white band, a 5 millimetres wide orange band and a 6 millimetres wide dark blue band, repeated in reverse order and separated by a 1 millimetre wide orange band in the centre. ;Versions The early medals and ribbon suspenders were minted separately and attached to each other with rings which enabled the medal to swing. On the original medal, the roundel on the obverse was also minted separately. The earliest version of the medal was minted by the South African Mint, but from c. 1980, further production of the medal was put out to tender by private enterprises. As a result, several versions appeared, nearly all minted with the ribbon suspender as an integral part of the medal and some still with a separately minted roundel, some without the gilding, and some minted with both the ribbon suspender and the roundel as an integral part of the medal. Mentioned in dispatches Mentioned in Dispatches A recipient of the Pro Patria Medal who was mentioned in dispatches during the 1966-1989 Border War, was entitled to wear a miniature Coat of Arms on the medal ribbon and ribbon bar. Clasps and Bars ;Clasps Only the Cunene clasp was awarded, to members who served in Angola during Operation Savannah in 1975 and 1976. Recipients of the clasp wear a button, with the letter C encircled by a wreath, on the ribbon bar. ;Bars Although the 1974 warrant made provision for bars, none were authorised. Discontinuation Conferment of the Pro Patria Medal was discontinued in respect of services performed on or after 27 April 2003.

His most notable contribution to botany was the founding of the long-lived journal \\"Flora Batava\\" in 1800 and contributing text for the first 10 volumes. Biography Jan Kops was the son of Jacobus Kops, a yarn merchant, and Hillegond Schotvanger, both conservative Old Frisian Mennonites. On the death of his father in December 1773, Jan Kops with his stepmother and sister moved from Amsterdam to Haarlem, where he received tuition first at the French and then at the Latin school. He was expected to follow the family tradition of a career in the textile industry, but Kops was ambitious and wanted a more extensive education. For the moment he immersed himself in a study of Dutch literature and botany. In December 1781 Kops enrolled at the Amsterdam Theological Seminary, a move which was not his first choice, as he would rather have followed his interest in botany and natural history, but understood that these were not lucrative fields. Anabaptists, such as Kops, were systematically excluded from public office. However this did not deter Kops from attending courses in the natural sciences at the Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam. In April 1787 Kops passed his examination at the Anabaptist seminary and served as pastor at Leiden until 1800, enrolling at the local university for a number of courses. In his spare time he was kept busy by his interest in literature. A great setback in Kops' church career was his being passed over in 1792 as preacher for the Haarlem congregation, the same thing happening in Amsterdam. Kops was furious over this and sought diversion in botany. As a consequence the first part of \\"Flora Batava\\" appeared in 1800. The Batavian Revolution led to the Mennonites' being placed on equal footing with the Dutch Reformed Church, and in 1795 and 1796 he was a member and chairman of Leiden's local authority. Kops next turned his attention to agriculture, and looked into the possibility of turning the dune region into productive farmland. He assembled a panel of agricultural experts and approached the Provincial Administration of Holland, setting out his ideas. His proposals met with a favourable reception and in September 1796 a study group was put together with Kops as secretary, and a report soon followed. His reputation as agronomist firmly established by the report, he was appointed in June 1800 as director of agriculture in the Netherlands, causing him to leave the ministry in Leiden and take up an office at The Hague, a post he was to fill until 1815. In this new capacity Kops undertook a tour of five months through the Netherlands, enabling him to personally judge the state of the nation's agriculture. On his initiative the first Dutch agricultural magazine Magazijn van Vaderlandschen Landbouw appeared between 1803 and 1814. He also initiated the formation of 10 regional agricultural commissions to advise the government. In 1808 he established the first \\"Agricultural Cabinet\\" to provide farmers with assistance and advice on farming equipment and implements. His previous interests resurfaced and in 1815 he was appointed professor of botany and agricultural economics at the University of Utrecht, a position he would hold until 1835. In this period he also preached as minister from 1816 to 1843 to the Mennonites in Utrecht, The Hague and Amsterdam.Kops, Jan (1765-1849) on GAMEO Flora Batava The first issue of \\"Flora Batava\\" was published in Amsterdam in 1800, with illustrations that were provided by artists working under J. C. Sepp & Son. The publisher Jan Christiaan Sepp was not only a Mennonite, but also an engraver, etcher, bookseller, author and illustrator. The final issue, volume 28, was published in 1934. Willem Jan Lütjeharms, the editor for that volume, stated that the work had ended and its publication had stretched over more years than any other botanical magazine. The work of text, illustrations and printing had changed hands many times during the course of its history. Several artists had produced the illustrations, but since the plates were unsigned, attribution is difficult. Most of the illustrations in the first three volumes were from the hand of (Georg Jacob Johann van Os), a flower and fruit painter for the Sèvres porcelain factory. Kops chose the title of his work for historical reasons; \\"Batavia\\" was a region of the Netherlands when it still formed part of the Roman Empire. Flora Batava was the name given the garden of Agnes Block (1629-1704), an art collector and horticulturist. She was the daughter of a Mennonite textile merchant and after the death of her first husband she bought a country estate on the Vecht River in Loenen and named it Vijverhof. A procession of artists, including Maria Sibylla Merian, visited her home and left behind a large number of paintings of flowers from her garden. Kops married Catharina Daams (1768-1805) in January 1788, the marriage producing 6 sons and 5 daughters. After the death of Catharina in 1805, Kops was married in 1807 to Helena Biljouw (1774-1855). From this marriage came 5 sons and 1 daughter, 3 of the 5 sons dying young.Geschiedenis.nl References External links *Flora Batava online *Profile (Utrecht University) Category:1765 births Category:1849 deaths Category:18th-century Anabaptist ministers Category:19th-century Anabaptist ministers Category:Dutch botanists Category:18th-century Dutch botanists Category:19th-century Dutch botanists Category:Dutch agronomists Category:Mennonite ministers Category:Mennonite writers Category:People from Amsterdam Category:Scientists from Amsterdam ","title":"Jan Kops"},{"id":"35766825","text":"The Fry Bread House is a restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona, serving Indian fry bread, a Native American staple made from white flour, baking powder, salt and lard or Crisco.

Walter's son recalled in a 1986 interview that the first pit setup was \\"a hole in the ground, some iron pipes and a piece of fence wire, and two pieces of tin.\\" The next owner was Walter's son, Hubert Jones. Hubert's son told Saveur that his father's original place was called The Hole in the Wall, because \\"that's what it was. Just a window in a wall where they sold meat from a washtub.\\" Hubert moved the business to its current location in 1964 and changed its name to Jones Bar-B-Q. The next and current owner is Hubert's son, James Jones, and his wife Betty. In 2010 James Jones told Oxford American that his son, a local coach, was not planning to continue operating the business. In 2017 James Jones shared his recipes and permission to use the business name with Kevin Arnold, who opened a Jones Bar-B-Q in Jacksonville, Arkansas, about away.  Operation  The Marianna diner is located in a white cinder block two-story shotgun house on a corner lot at 219 West Louisiana Street.Winners 2012 James Beard Foundation Hubert Jones and his wife lived upstairs when they operated it. Jones smokes 10 to 12 pork shoulders over oak and hickory in cinder-block pits for at least ten hours three times a week. He simmers the cooked meat in sauce in a slow cooker. The sauce is thin and vinegar-based and contains paprika and cayenne. The menu offers only chopped pork, either by the pound or as sandwiches on white bread such as Wonder or Sunbeam, with or without a mustard-based coleslaw. As of August 2019, sandwiches were US$3.50, a pound of meat US$7.00 and a pint of sauce US$3.00. The diner opens at 6 a.m. six days a week and closes whenever it sells out, often by 11 a.m. According to The Chicago Tribune, \\"On a summer Saturday, that could happen before 10 a.m.\\" There are only two tables, providing seating for at most ten. As of 2010 the restaurant offered smoking service to hunters who would bring their catches in.

According to The Chicago Tribune, University of Mississippi academic John Edge \\"helped nudge the Beard Foundation\\" to consider the diner.

Afterward, as they are walking away, Frog starts playing tag and they all have a wonderful afternoon, prompting Frog to exclaim, \\"Isn't life beautiful!\\" As they return home at sundown, another blackbird starts singing a beautiful song, \\"as it always does,\\" indicating that life goes on. History and critical response Velthuijs first published Frog and the Birdsong in 1991 with Leopold, a Dutch publisher of children's books. It won the 1992 Gouden Griffel, one of the most significant Dutch prizes for children's books, and was a runner-up for the companion award for illustrations, the Gouden Penseel. By 2003, it was in its fourteenth printing. The book was digitized by the Digital Library for Dutch Literature and is available online. It is translated into English and published by Andersen Press. Educational and therapeutic use Children often first encounter death in animals, and many children's books have used animal characters to explain death since that helps to create a certain distance which children consider less threatening, according to Nicholas Tucker in The Child and the Book. Frog and the Birdsong takes the reader through the rituals associated with death and ends on an optimistic note with the resumption of normalcy, symbolized by the birdsong. The book is suggested by many educational specialists as recommended reading for children to acquaint them with death, as reading material and as classroom prompts for activities. In Dutch schools it has found frequent use in the classroom. In Pondering: 49 philosophical questions from children, Frog and the Birdsong is the selected reading for a group session on what it means to be dead. It is frequently suggested to prompt children to discuss death and their feelings about it, even in a school for deaf children, accompanied by sign language. In a school for special education the book is also used in memorial services.

The movie had big repercussions in Brazil, catalyzing debates in the media, in schools and even in Brazilian Congress, with a speech by Senator Eduardo Suplicy. Veja magazine published a 9-page article which characterized the film as a “meticulous report done in 2 years with 168 interviews with notable personalities”. Rede Globo’s prime-time variety show Fantástico exhibited an 8-minute segment about the film and made a poll with the viewers. 57% of them favored legalization of drugs. The documentary was also subject of a cover story of Trip magazine. It received very positive reviews from national and international publications, such as Folha de S. Paulo and The Guardian.

Lyman, from The Hollywood Reporter, it was one of the “weekend highlights”. Wandering Heart was one of the last filmed records of Michelangelo Antonioni, who passed away in 2007. The film critic and founder of It’s All True Festival, Amir Labaki, considered the documentary “the most revealing portrait of Caetano”.

Jones was acquitted of the murder of his first victim, 8-year-old Freda Burnell, at Monmouthshire Assizes on 21 June 1921. Just 17 days later, he murdered an 11-year-old neighbour named Florence Little. Jones pleaded guilty to Little's murder and also confessed to having murdered Freda Burnell at his second trial. Owing to his being under 16 at the time he committed the murders, Jones escaped capital punishment for his crimes; instead being sentenced to be detained at His Majesty's pleasure on 1 November 1921. Jones was released from prison in 1941, later marrying and fathering a child. He died of bone cancer in 1971 at the age of 64. Early life Harold Jones was born in the Welsh colliery town of Abertillery in January 1906, the eldest of four children born into a poor family. His father, Phillip,Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 85 worked as a coal miner and his mother was a housewife.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 86 Jones and his siblings attended a local council school where he was regarded as a popular and exemplary student, showing a particular flair for sports, and holding aspirations to become a professional boxer. He is also known to have spent much of his free time reading, and to have occasionally played the organ at local church services.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 73 Jones left school at 14 to obtain employment—largely as a means of supplementing his family's income. He found employment at a local oil and seed merchant named Mortimer's Stores. Here, he was known to be a punctual and trustworthy employee who was both capable of managing the shop without help, and popular with customers.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 pp. 86-87 Murders =Freda Burnell= On the afternoon of 5 February 1921, an eight-year-old girl named Freda Elsie Burnell was reported missing by her parents. She had last been seen by her father, Fred,The Who's Who of British Crime: In the Twentieth Century p. 177 at approximately 9 o'clock that morning, having been sent on an errand from her home at 9 Earl Street to purchase poultry spice and grit from Mortimer's Stores in nearby Somerset Street to feed the family livestock, with her father promising her a penny upon her return. Freda Burnell Somerset Street, Abertillery, c. 1910. Freda Burnell disappeared from this street on 5 February 1921 When Burnell had not returned home after an hour, her frantic parents began making inquiries, including at the store Freda had been sent to visit. The 15-year-old assistant at this store, Harold Jones, confirmed to Freda's father (and later the police) that Freda had visited the store at approximately 9:05 a.m. and that he had served her a bag of poultry spice, adding that she had also asked for a bag of poultry grit but he had informed her the store only had loose poultry grit.The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers p. 232 The child, he claimed, had left the store to ask her father whether loose poultry grit would suffice, and he had not seen her since.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 79 By 3 p.m., the Burnell family had informed police Freda was missing, and an exhaustive search for the child was launched.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 78 The following morning, Burnell's body was found by a collier concealed in a sack in an alleyway just 300 yards from the store she had visited. Her cause of death was certified as being a combination of blunt trauma to her head and strangulation evident via a cord still tied around her neck, with the time of death having been between 9:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. on the date of her disappearance. In addition, Freda had been gagged, her elbows had been bound behind her back, and her ankles were knotted together. An attempt had also been made to rape the child. Traces of corn chaff were also found upon and around her body, and inside the sack in which she was discovered.The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers pp. 232-233 Investigators noted that a chicken run in the shed belonging to Harold Jones's employers located just a few hundred yards from where the body had been discovered had corn chaff extensively scattered upon the ground, and a handkerchief known to have been in Freda's possession at the time of her disappearance was also found on the ground in the shed. In addition, an axe handle determined to have caused the blunt trauma to Freda's head was discovered concealed beneath some sacking inside the shed. Aside from his employers, Jones was the only individual in possession of a key to the shed, and investigators established a clear time frame of between 9:15 and 9:40 a.m. when no witnesses had physically seen him inside the store.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 84 A friend of Jones named Levi Meyrick also informed police Jones had actively dissuaded him and another youth named Frank MortimerFoul Deeds & Suspicious Deaths in Newport p. 75 from accompanying him to the storage shed at approximately 10:20 p.m. on 5 February; another witness also informed police he had heard a female child's screams emanating from this shed on the actual morning of Burnell's disappearance. When questioned as to these facts, Jones insisted he had not been in the shed on the day of Freda's disappearance. Nonetheless, investigators were convinced otherwise, and he was held in detention at Abertillery Police Station to await the outcome of the coroner's inquest. The inquest into the death of Burnell was formally opened on 7 March. Jones was one of many individuals called to testify at this inquest. He performed poorly on the stand; repeatedly giving conflicting testimony as to his actions on the day of the murder and being forced to admit to lying about various aspects of his testimony (on one occasion prompting the coroner to scold him and insist he tell the truth). Nonetheless, despite there being little physical evidence linking Jones to the murder, investigators believed enough circumstantial evidence existed to formally charge him with the crime. In response to this formal charge, Jones replied: \\"I know it looks black against me, but I never done it.\\"Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 75 He was remanded in custody until 5 April when he appeared before magistrates. On this date, a decision to try Jones for the wilful murder of Freda Burnell was reached. Bail was refused, and he was detained at Usk Prison to await trial. =Initial trial= Jones was brought to trial for the murder of Burnell at Monmouthshire Assizes on 21 June. The prosecution alleged that he had murdered Burnell inside the shed belonging to his employers on the morning of 5 February before placing her body in a sack, and placing the body in an alley close to the shed that evening.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 pp. 84-85 He pleaded not guilty to the charge, insisting that he had last seen Freda when he had served her at approximately 9:05 a.m. before she had left the store. Although Jones had contradicted himself on several occasions at the initial inquest, he remained calm when called to testify in his own defence at trial, also withstanding rigorous cross-examination. His employer, Herbert Henry Mortimer, provided him with an alibi, insisting he had heard Jones and his own son working in the store in the early morning of 5 February before the two had been sent to deliver a sack of potatoes to a customer at approximately 10 a.m., later returning to the store where they had continued to work for the rest of the day. Furthermore, on the third day of the trial Jones's own father challenged the prosecutor's contention his son had placed Freda's body in the alley on the evening of her murder, insisting his son had not left the family home between the time he had returned home from work and the following morning, and that he would likely have known so had this been the case. His testimony was corroborated by his wife, who also stressed her son had always exhibited \\"good behaviour\\" towards young girls. Despite the evidence presented at this trial clearly indicating that Freda had most likely been killed in the shed belonging to Jones's employers and only Harold and the Mortimer family having access to the key, after deliberating for over five hours, the jury found Jones not guilty of Freda's murder, returning a unanimous verdict of murder by person or persons unknown.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 83 Jones walked free from the courtroom to a private and reportedly tearful reunion with his parents before being escorted to a local restaurant for a meal. At this service, Jones stood upon a table and addressed his numerous supportersDark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 76 with a speech in which he stated: \\"I thank you all. I do not hold a grudge against the people of Abertillery for the horrendous ordeal I have been put through.\\" He subsequently returned to Abertillery in a charabanc adorned with flags and bunting to cheers from the local public, most of whom found the notion that a 15-year-old boy could sexually assault and kill a child simply inconceivable.A Question of Evidence: The Casebook of Great Forensic Controversies, from Napoleon to O.J. p. 139 One of those to greet Jones upon his return was a neighbour named George Little, who greeted him with the statement: \\"Well done, lad. We knew you didn't do it.\\" Florence Little =Florence Little= Seventeen days after Jones's acquittal of Burnell's murder, on 8 July, he observed a neighbour of his named Florence Irene Little playing hopscotch with his sister, Flossie, outside his home at 10 Darran Road. He lured Little into his house on the pretext of asking her to perform an errand for his family. Inside Jones's home, she was instantly partially strangled and dragged into the kitchen, where she was beaten across the head and temple with a plank of wood before Jones suspended her head and neck over his sink, grabbed her by the hair, and cut her throat with his father's pocketknife.The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers p. 233 He then wrapped Florence's head and neck in a grey army shirt before concealing her partially dressed body in the family attic. Having washed all the bloodstains he noted from the sink, walls, floor, and entrance hatch to the attic, Jones proceeded to bathe himself. Police were notified of Florence's disappearance at 11:15 p.m., and immediately conducted house-to-house searches. The simultaneous searches of nearby woodland and mountains were assisted by hundreds of local volunteers including Harold Jones.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 77 Questioned by police as to whether he had seen Florence on the day of her disappearance, Jones repeated the same lie he had earlier recited to Mrs. Little when she had called upon his house asking as to her daughter's whereabouts: that she had been at his front door, but had then simply \\"ran off.\\" With Jones's father's consent, the local superintendent, Henry Lewis, and a constable searched Jones's home at 8:30 a.m. the following day as Harold discreetly exited the family home.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 88 Noting the trap door to the attic was bloodstained despite evident attempts to clean it, the constable conducting the search entered the attic where he discovered Little's body outstretched across the rafters. Also discovered in the police search of Jones's home were the bloodstained knife Jones had used to murder Florence, a small egg-saucepan filled with a mixture of blood and water beneath the sink over which he had cut the child's throat, a bloodstained plank of wood measuring 19 inches in length concealed beneath the family boiler, and a bloodstained table close to the entrance to the attic in which Florence's body had been concealed.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 89 Informed of the discovery in his attic, Phillip Jones left his property and performed a citizen's arrest on his son as he conversed with a friend in nearby Mitre Street. Jones then accompanied his father back to Darran Road, where he was placed under arrest.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 91 When news of Jones's arrest for the suspected murder of a second young girl reached the local public, an irate crowd of approximately 500 people gathered outside the local police station, demanding his immediate release. In response, Superintendent Lewis addressed the crowd, stating: \\"I have found the body of the child in the attic of Harold Jones, foully murdered, and I have arrested Harold Jones. I think this is all I can tell you and it would help us if you disperse and go to your homes.\\"Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 87 Second murder inquest On 11 July, an inquest into the death of Little was formally opened. Again conducted by the deputy coroner for the district, the jury heard testimony on this date that Little had bled to death from the wound to her throat. Also to testify at the inquest was Little's mother, Elsie, who stated that when she had knocked at the Jones residence on the date of her daughter's disappearance, it had taken Jones (the sole occupant in the house at the time) a full two minutes to answer the door, with the explanation he had been bathing when she called. When she asked Jones whether he had seen her daughter, he had smiled before replying: \\"Florrie's been here, but went through the back way.\\" The inquest was adjourned until 23 July, with the jury subsequently reaching a unanimous verdict of wilful murder against Jones after just 30 minutes' deliberation. When asked if he had anything to say in relation to this verdict and his being committed to again stand trial at Monmouthshire Assizes for a child murder, Jones—having taken copious notes of the court proceedings—reportedly jumped to his feet and proclaimed his innocence. He was again detained at Usk Prison to await trial.The Who's Who of British Crime: In the Twentieth Century p. 178 While awaiting trial, Jones formally confessed to the murder of Florence Little via a written statement dated 17 September. In this statement, Jones described his motive for the murder as being a \\"desire to kill\\". Trial and conviction The trial of Jones for the murder of Little began at Monmouthshire Assizes on 1 November 1921. He was tried before Mr Justice Bray, with the prosecution contending this murder had been primarily committed due to Jones having enjoyed being \\"a part of the public eye\\" due to the attention he had received following his arrest and acquittal of Burnell's murder weeks earlier, adding that he had made evident attempts to conceal evidence of the crime within his home after the murder. The trial lasted just one hour; Jones was ordered to be detained at His Majesty's pleasure. As he was under 16 at the time of conviction, he could not be subjected to any form of capital punishment. Shortly after Jones was escorted to prison to begin his sentence, a second written statement was read aloud to the court. This statement—also penned prior to his trial—read: \\"I, Harold Jones, wilfully and deliberately murdered Freda Burnell in Mortimer's Shed on 5 February 1921. The reason for this act was a desire to kill.\\" HM Prison Usk. Jones was sentenced to be detained at His Majesty's pleasure at this prison on 1 November 1921 Aftermath Jones served 20 years of his imposed sentence of life imprisonment. Against the recommendations of a psychiatrist,Exposing Jack the Stripper: A Biography of the Worst Serial Killer You've Probably Never Heard Of p. 176 he was released from prison on parole on 6 December 1941 at age 35, and subsequently joined the Merchant Navy. At the conclusion of the Second World War, Jones briefly resided in Newport, although by 1948, he is known to have relocated to Fulham, London, using the alias Harry Stevens. He later married and fathered a child. Jones died of bone cancer on 2 January 1971.The Who's Who of British Crime: In the Twentieth Century pp. 177-179 At the time of his death, he was employed as a night watchman and living under the alias of Harry Jones, although before he died, he told his wife the name Harold Jones should be written on his death certificate.Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016 p. 95 Shortly after the murder of Little, his employer, Herbert Mortimer, closed his shop and relocated with his family from Abertillery to an unknown location. Reportedly, this decision was made due to both a mixture of ostracization from locals regarding the false testimony he had delivered at Jones's trial for the murder of Burnell, and his own guilt that this false testimony had enabled Jones to subsequently remain at liberty and kill again. Both Burnell and Little were buried in Brynithel Cemetery. Their graves fell into a state of disrepair over the decades, although a 2017 appeal initiated by a local author named Neil Milkins to restore their graves and headstones raised more than £4,000, he having been inspired to do so after speaking to relatives of both girls, who were upset by the state of disrepair of the graves. The girls' graves were subsequently restored in 2018.

Their most successful songs included \\"Piangi con Me\\" (Italian version) = \\"Passing Through Grey (English version), the original version of \\"Let's Live for Today\\" a US hit when re-recorded by The Grass Roots; and \\"Che Colpa Abbiamo Noi\\", an Italian language version of \\"Cheryl's Going Home\\" by Bob Lind. Career Norman David \\"Shel\\" Shapiro (born 16 August 1943, Stanmore, Middlesex) began performing in London as a guitarist and singer with rock and roll band Rob Storm & the Whispers. After a spell playing in Gene Vincent's backing band during a tour of Britain in 1959, Shapiro decided to form his own band, The Shel Carson Combo, with guitarist Vic Briggs (born 14 February 1945, Twickenham, Middlesex), drummer Mike Shepstone (born 29 March 1943, Weymouth, Dorset), and bassist Bobby Posner (born 6 May 1945, Edgware, Middlesex). The band performed rhythm and blues in clubs around London and had regular shows at American base camps around the south of England plus a couple of tours in the north including Scotland, before deciding to try their luck in the club scene in continental Europe. In January 1963, they travelled to Germany, where they had a residency at the Top Ten Club in Hamburg with a short stay at the TopTen Club in Hanover. The band were then invited to tour Italy as the backing group for Colin Hicks, the brother of Tommy Steele. Guitarist Vic Briggs left the group, preferring to stay in England, and was replaced by Johnny Charlton (born 3 April 1945, Walthamstow, London). The group toured around Italy with Hicks, increasingly performing more of their own material. In June 1963, they broke their ties with Hicks and were signed up by Teddy Reno, the manager and husband of Italian pop singer Rita Pavone. They toured with Pavone, appearing as the Shel Carson Combo warming up the fans before Rita did her show. They then gained a recording contract with the ARC label and renamed themselves The Rokes for their first single, a cover version of Big Joe Turner's \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\", was unsuccessful, but the band established themselves with a club residency in Rome at The Piper Club. The Rokes completed a series of short commercial videos on Italian TV (Algida).On later recordings, they sang mainly in English-accented Italian, often recording versions of American and British chart hits. In 1965, their version of Jackie DeShannon's \\"When You Walk in the Room\\" (\\"C'e Una Strana Espressione Nei Tuoi Occhi\\"), reached no. 11 on the Italian charts, followed by \\"Grazie a Te\\", a cover of \\"I'm Alive\\" by The Hollies. In 1966, they were voted the second most popular beat group in Italy, after further hits with versions of Bob Lind's songs \\"Cheryl's Going Home\\" (\\"Che Colpa Abbiamo Noi\\") and \\"Remember The Rain\\" (\\"E La Pioggia Che Va\\"). The B-side of \\"Che Colpa Abbiamo Noi\\" was a song co-written by Shapiro, \\"Piangi Con Me\\". The group re-recorded the song in English, as \\"Let's Live for Today\\", with English lyrics by Michael Julian of Dick James Music. Worldwide sales of \\"Piangi Con Me\\" exceeded one million copies, qualifying for a gold disc. It was released in England at the same time as a cover version by another English band, The Living Daylights. The song was heard by American record producers P. F. Sloan and Steve Barri, and successfully recorded by them with The Grass Roots. The Rokes released four albums between 1965 and 1968, and continued to record successfully in Italy. They also toured and appeared regularly on Italian TV shows and in several of the annual San Remo Festival events. They ventured into psychedelic rock in 1967 with \\"Il Vento\\" (by Mogol and Lucio Battisti), also recorded in English as \\"When the Wind Arises\\", and recorded a version of The Equals' UK hit \\"Baby Come Back\\" (\\"Non c'è Pace Per Me\\"). However, their records had little success outside Italy due to RCA/ARC's lack of interest on the publicity, and, with changing tastes and declining sales, the group disbanded in 1970 having sold more than 5 million vinyl records and continue to sell CD's compilations and box sets. Later activities Shapiro continued to compose and perform his own music. He recorded seven albums and briefly embarked on an acting career, working with directors such as Mario Monicelli and Marco Risi. In 1977 he founded his own label in Milan. In 2018 he recorded an album with former rival and Equipe 84 lead vocalist Maurizio Vandelli. Johnny Charlton opened his own art gallery, Galleria Charlton, in Rome. He now works as a visual artist. Bobby Posner and Mike Shepstone initially returned to England. Posner bought various pubs in London and eventually sold these and moved to Hastings on the south coast where he acquired other music pubs. He never stopped playing and performed in different rock, reggae, and blues bands. Mike Shepstone formed the duo 'Shepstone and Dibbens', toured with AC/DC and continued to write songs as well for other artists. In 2000, serious discussions about putting the band back together for an Italian tour gained momentum. However, Shapiro and Charlton weren't interested, so Posner and Shepstone decided to form 'The Rokes M&B;' (Mike and Bobby). They have been playing regularly in Italy since 2000. In 2013 Posner moved permanently back to Italy and now lives with his fiancee Paola Salvadeo in Novi Ligure (AL).

The company was founded in 2005 by Hamdi Ulukaya who had bought a plant in the town of South Edmeston, New York, that was being closed by Kraft Foods. Ulukaya hired several of the former Kraft employees as well as a \\"yogurt master\\" and launched his brand in 2007. Chobani sells thick, Greek-style yogurt with a higher protein content than traditional yogurt and is one of the main companies to popularize this style of yogurt. The company has also expanded to non-dairy, plant-based products such as dairy-free vegan yogurt and oat milk. The company promotes its products as health food. Chobani is the top-selling Greek yogurt brand in America and operates the largest yogurt facility in the world. Its products include a variety of Greek, or strained, yogurt cups, flips, drinks, and children's snacks, dairy-based coffee creamers, as well as plant-based products made with organic oats or coconut.  History  Chobani was founded in 2005 by Turkish-Kurdish businessman Hamdi Ulukaya. He chose the name Chobani as a variation of the modern Turkish word çoban, from Ottoman Turkish چوبان : čobân; itself derived from Persian چوپان : čupân , which itself has a European language root from Alexander the great invasion as “Sheep ban”, meaning \\"shepherd.\\" Chobani was inspired by Ulukaya's childhood spent raising sheep and goats and making cheese with his family. Not impressed by the yogurt options available in the United States, Ulukaya made strained yogurt at his home in Upstate NY. In 2005, after seeing an ad for a former Kraft Foods yogurt plant for sale in South Edmeston, New York, Ulukaya decided to buy it with a Small Business Administration Loan. He launched the strained yogurt business with the help of a handful of the plant's former employees. His goal was to provide Americans with a more authentic, nutritious and accessible yogurt. In less than five years after the launch, Chobani realized over $1 billion in annual sales and became the leading seller of Greek yogurt in America. In November 2011, Chobani expanded into Victoria, Australia through the purchase of Victorian dairy company Bead Foods. It then invested $30m to expand the facility and began manufacturing from the Dandenong South plant in December 2012. In 2012, Chobani became an official sponsor of the US Olympic Team and premiered their first national commercial during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. In 2012, the brand opened its second plant in what became the world's largest yogurt facility in Twin Falls, Idaho, with an initial investment of $750 million. The move created approximately 7,000 jobs, and unemployment rates in the region dropped from 6.3% to 2.4%. Chobani also opened its first brick-and-mortar cafe in SoHo, NYC in July 2012. In 2013, Chobani was ordered to change their yogurt's labeling in England and Wales after a judge ruled that the wording \\"Greek yoghurt\\" (rather than Greek-style) misled consumers into thinking the yogurt was made in Greece (yogurt imported from Greece is sold in Britain, and is the only type sold as \\"Greek\\").Andrew Trotman \\"Chobani misled UK shoppers into thinking yoghurt was made in Greece: The US maker of Chobani yoghurt has been ordered to change the product's labelling in England and Wales after a judge ruled it was misleading shoppers,\\" The Telegraph (28 March 2013).Julia Glotz \\"Fage scores victory against Chobani in Greek yoghurt case,\\" The Grocer (28 March 2013). On September 3, 2013, Chobani pulled some of its Greek-style yogurt from supermarket shelves after hearing of \\"swelling or bloating\\" in cups. The company said it has investigated and found a type of mold commonly found in dairy that may be to blame. Chobani announced a voluntary recall on September 5 in cooperation with the FDA. On September 9, 2013, the FDA reported at least 89 people reported becoming sick after eating the yogurt. The Twin Falls plant won the 2013 DBIA Design-Build Project of the Year award and the 2013 Food Plant of the Year award from Food Engineering magazine. In April 2016, CEO Hamdi Ulukaya announced that he would be giving Chobani employees 10% of the company's shares. In October 2016, the company announced that it was implementing a program to give six weeks of paid parental leave to new parents. Chobani introduced its products in Mexico in August 2016. In 2017, Chobani surpassed Yoplait as the No. 2 manufacturer in overall yogurt. That same year, the company introduced new packaging and a new brand identity as a “food-focused wellness company.” The company also announced a $20 million expansion of the Twin Falls plant, with a 70,000 square-foot sustainable facility and a new global research and development center. When Chobani was launched, Greek yogurt made up less than 1% of the yogurt market in the U.S. As of 2017, Greek yogurt accounted for 50% of U.S. yogurt sales. In the spring of 2018, CEO Hamdi Ulukaya appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show and Good Morning America to announce that the company was celebrating its 10th anniversary as a national brand by giving a Chobani yogurt to every person in America. In August 2018, the company launched Chobani Savor, a brand for their yogurt-based condiment. In November 2019, Chobani introduced plant-based beverages made with organic oats and Chobani Coffee Creamer, made with milk and cream that comes naturally from the company's yogurt-making process.  Mission  Chobani states that its mission is to provide \\"better food to more people,\\" and it identifies as a \\"food-focused wellness company.\\"  Community responsibility  = Giving Back = Since the founding, Chobani has donated a portion of profits back into the communities where its employees live and work. The company's philanthropy focuses on improving childhood nutrition, strengthening the communities near its plants in New York and Idaho, and supporting those in need after major disasters in the U.S. In November 2018, Chobani announced a new partnership with the national nonprofit Operation Homefront, with the aim of raising $1 million for America's military families. The funds will help in the delivery of critical financial assistance and support for military families across the nation. Chobani donated $500,000 and the company pledged to match up to $250,000 in additional donations facilitated by a new Chobani product called “Hero Batch” Red, White and Blueberry Greek yogurt. The new product was designed by military veterans at Chobani. In May 2019, CEO Ulukaya pledged to pay the student lunch debt for all Warwick school district students in Rhode Island and urged other companies to step up to fight food insecurity across the country. In October 2019, Chobani launched a limited edition product, Farmer Batch. For every four-pack sold, the company donated ten cents to the American Farmland Trust (AFT). = Chobani Incubator = Hamdi Ulukaya launched the Chobani Food Incubator in 2016 to support food entrepreneurs aiming to challenge the food industry, improve broken systems, and bring better food to more people. The program provides food and beverage startups with a nonequity investment, resources, mentorship and programming. In 2018, the company announced the creation of the Chobani Incubator Food Tech Residency. Participants in the incubator program include: Banza, Misfit Juicery, Chloe's Fruit, Pique Tea Crystals, NOKA, MatchaBar, Ithaca Cold-Crafted, and more. In November 2019, the Chobani Incubator introduced its new Vets Cohort to help current and former armed service members who are also food entrepreneurs grow their business. The program was formed through a partnership with the Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University. = Chobani shares = In April 2016, Chobani announced it was giving 10 percent of its ownership stake to its employees. The company allotted shares to its employees based on tenure, reportedly helping some of the company's longest serving employees become millionaires. = Paid parental leave = Effective in 2017, Chobani implemented a new paid parental leave policy, offering 100% paid parental leave for six weeks for all full-time hourly and salaried employees that have completed at least 12 months of continuous employment. The program extends to both mothers and fathers for the birth, adoption, or placement of a foster child into the home.  Hiring refugees  In 2016, following reports on Chobani's practice of employing refugees, the company received calls for boycotts and death threats. Approximately 30% of Chobani's 2,000 employees are legally resettled refugees and immigrants.  Alex Jones lawsuit  In April 2017, Chobani filed a defamation lawsuit in Idaho state court against Alex Jones following a number of allegations made on the InfoWars website. As a result of the lawsuit, Jones issued an apology and retracted his allegations on May 17, 2017.

The project was finally shelved in the 1980s after public outrage in the wake of the murder of opposition leader Macli-ing Dulag. It is now considered a landmark case study concerning ancestral domain issues in the Philippines.http://cpcabrisbane.org/Kasama/1996/V10n2/Innabuyog.htm  History  =Proposal= The Chico River Basin Development Project was first conceived in 1965, but was not considered financially feasible until the OPEC Oil Price Hike of 1973. The resulting quadrupling of the price of oil led the government of President Ferdinand Marcos to tap the German firm Lahmeyer International in cooperation with the Engineering and Development Corporation of the Philippines, to develop a technical feasibility. The Marcos administration then sought funds from the World Bank in order to fund the project. The plan involved the construction of four dams along the Chico River: * Chico I was expected to produce 100 Megawatts, with its site in Sabangan, Mountain Province; * Chico II was expected to produce 360 Megawatts, with its site in Sadanga, Mountain Province; * Chico III was expected to produce 100 Megawatts, with its site in Barrio Basao in the Municipality of Tinglayan in present-day Kalinga Province; and * Chico IV was expected to produce 450 Megawatts, with its site in the Bario of Tomiangan, in Tabuk, now a city in Kalinga. The technical feasibility study was submitted by Lahmeyer in June 1973, without the knowledge of the indigenous people who were to be displaced by the project. They would only find out in 1974, when the Marcos government started conducting surveys in preparation for the construction of Dams II and IV. = Implications for affected communities = Even if only Dam IV were built, the project watershed would have encompassed the municipalities of Tinglayan, Lubuagan, Pasil, and parts of Tabuk in Kalinga Province, and the municipalities of Sabangan, Sagada, Sadanga, Bontoc, Bauko, and parts of Barlig in Mountain Province. Contemporary estimates suggested that the project would displace about 100,000 people, mostly from the indigenous Kalinga and Bontoc peoples. In Kalinga, the barrios of Ableg, Cagaluan, Dupag, Tanglag, Dognac, and Mabongtot would be completely submerged. Kalinga Apayao government estimated that more than 1000 families would be rendered homeless as a result, and P 31,500,000 worth of farmlands would be lost. An additional P 38,250,000 worth of rice fields farmed by the residents of Bangad, Lubuagan, Dangtalan, Guinaang, and Naneng would also be flooded, even if the villages themselves would not be submerged. The Marcos government offered various financial incentives if the communities agreed to be relocated, but these overtures were rejected by the communities because of the significance of the lands to their religious beliefs and to the legal system which shaped the relationship of their tribes and communities to one another. The indigenous religious beliefs of the Kalinga place a strong emphasis on ancestor worship, and because these ancestors were buried within the communities themselves, the communities were essentially sacred burial grounds. Macli-ing Dulag, pangat (leader) of the Butbut people of Kalinga, is quoted by journalist Ma. Ceres Doyo expressing this sentiment: > ...the question of the dam is more than political. The question is life—our > Kalinga life. Apo Kabunian, the Lord of us all, gave us this land. It is > sacred, nourished by our sweat. It shall become even more sacred when it is > nourished by our blood. In addition, legal and tribal relationships among Kalinga communities are expressed in peace pacts called bodong, which together form a system of laws and agreements (pagta ti bodong) which are defined by each tribe's geographical territory. This entire system of laws and the social organization built around them would effectively be abolished if the communities are submerged or their populations relocated. = Early opposition against the dam = In 1974, the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR) began sending survey teams to the four dam sites, and opposition against the project began to mount. Macli-ing organized a bodong (peace council) in Barrio Tanglag in an attempt to rally opposition against the dam project. In May 1975, 150 papangat or village elders and peace makers from Kalinga and Bontoc created the Bodong Federation, Inc., which intended to work against the four hydroelectric dams that would deluge many Kalinga villages, including sacred burial grounds and rice terraces. This was the first time the Bontoc and Kalinga joined intertribal forces and declared their preparedness for armed resistance to defend their ancestral territory. Their plight was supported by many nongovernment organizations and religious groups such as the Episcopal Commission on Tribal Filipinos of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, which helped organize a conference involving 150 Bontoc and Kalinga leaders alongside church-based support groups, at St. Bridget's School in Quezon City. The conference resulted in an agreement (Pagta ti Bodong) which formally united the Bontoc and Kalinga peoples in opposition against the Marcos dam project. These early opposition efforts forced the Marcos administration to temporarily pull the NAPOCOR survey teams out of the area in 1975. = Militarization of the Chico IV area= Frustrated by the project delays caused by the opposition, Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Decree no. 848 on December 1975, constituting the municipalities of Lubuagan, Tinglayan, Tanudan, and Pasil into a \\"Kalinga Special Development Region\\" (KSDR), in an effort to neutralize opposition to the Chico IV dam. With the Philippines formally under Martial Law from 1972 to 1981, areas affected by the dam project were easily militarized. Aside from the Philippine Constabulary forces already assigned to the province, the 60th Philippine Constabulary Brigade, the 51st Philippine Constabulary Brigade, and the 44th Philippine Army Brigade were brought in to suppress opposition to the dam project. In 1977, numerous opposition leaders were rounded up by the military and incarcerated for two months. Opposition leaders were undaunted, and more bodong peace pacts ceremonies were organized - including two of the largest bodong councils ever, in June 1978, and December 1979. The December 1979 bodong was attended by 2,000 Kalingas and Bontocs and saw Macli-ing Dulag officially designated as the official spokesperson for the opposition effort. = Murder of Macli-ing Dulag and abandonment of the project = On 24 April 1980, armed forces under the command of then-President Ferdinand Marcos - identified in the press as elements from 4th Infantry Division of the Philippine Army \\\\- opened fire on Dulag at his home, killing him instantly. Macli-ing's murder unified the various peoples of the Cordillera Mountains against the proposed dam, causing both the World Bank and the Marcos regime to eventually abandon the project a few years after. Dulag's name has since been inscribed in the Bantayog ng mga Bayani (Monument of the Heroes) in Quezon City, Metro Manila, which is dedicated to the martyrs and heroes who fought victims against the abuses that took place during the Philippines under the Marcos Martial Law era, and April 24, the date of Dulag's murder, is one of two dates observed annually as \\"Cordillera Day\\" in the Cordillera Administrative Region.  In popular media  * The story of Macli-ing Dulag's opposition to the Chico River Dam Project features prominently as a plot point in Auraeus Solito's 2008 film \\"Pisay, which is set in the Philippine Science High School in Quezon City during the months leading up to the 1986 EDSA Revolution.\\" *The struggle of the Kalinga people opposing the construction of the Chico River Dam was depicted in the 1998 play Macli-ing Dulag. It was written by Malou Leviste Jacob and staged by the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA) under the direction of Soxy Topacio. Nanding Josef played Kalinga chief Macli-ing Dulag.

The Faculty is regarded as the largest faculty and the leading educational and research institution in the field of chemical engineering in Croatia.  Organization and functions  Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Technology is organized in several Departments and Chairs that perform teaching, scientific work, professional and consulting activities in chemical engineering, chemistry and other fields.  Brief history  Early beginnings of faculty go back to 1919 with foundation of the Technical Institute Zagreb with goal of educating professional experts, who previously went to study in Vienna or Prague, both in engineering and scientific fields. Among the six proposed departments was the Chemical-Technical Department, soon to be renamed into Chemical-Engineering Department. Vladimir Njegovan (1884–1971) was the first and only elected professor; his duty was to provide the necessary space (lecture rooms, offices and laboratories), laboratory equipment and to gather the teaching staff. He also held the first lecture in analytical chemistry, dated October 20, 1919. This date is currently celebrated as the Faculty Day. Professor Njegovan succeeded in forming a group of experienced, inventive teachers and scientists. The first teacher of organic chemistry was professor Ivan Marek (1863–1936), recognized for his later innovations and improvements of the furnace for organic elemental analysis. Professor Ivan Plotnikov (1878–1955), a collaborator of Wilhelm Ostwald and world-famous photochemist soon joined the staff to take chairs in physics and physical chemistry. The first professor of metallurgy and chemical technology was Franjo Hanaman, a co-inventor of the tungsten filament for electric lamps. In 1926 the Technical Institute joined the University of Zagreb, a much stronger institution with long tradition dating back to 1669. However, the chemical technology curriculum at the newly established Technical Faculty remained practically the same in the next few years. Especially noted position in history of the Faculty is reserved to professor Vladimir Prelog, winner of Nobel prize in chemistry in 1975, who held a chair in organic chemistry from 1934 to 1941 and established strong bonds with local scientist and also with industry in production of medicines but also interesting new molecules like adamantane. In 1956, after the independence of some Departments, Technical Faculty ceased to exist. chemical technology continues to work as newly established Faculty of Technology. From the latter one, with development and accentuation of particular professions in industry, in 1978 separates the Faculty of Metallurgy, in 1980 the Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology, and in 1991. the Faculty of Textile Technology and modern Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Technology.

The partnership is managed as a subsidiary of MediaNews Group, its majority owner. The minority partner is Stephens Media, with roughly a one- quarter ownership stake.  History  William Dean Singleton, founder of MediaNews, pushed for the partnership in 1999 as part of his \\"clustering\\" strategy of newspaper ownership — owning groups of newspapers in a geographic area for economies of scale. For example, he had acquired five dailies in Northern California in the mid-1990s and centralized their operations into one copy and layout desk, and one team for special sections such as sports and features. In an effort to achieve efficiencies on a larger scale, Singleton offered to pool its Bay Area papers — the Alamedia Newspaper Group — and the Los Angeles Daily News in a partnership with the Ontario, California, assets of Donrey Media Group (now called Stephens). A year after forming the partnership, the duo were joined by Gannett, which contributed the San Bernardino Sun and the Marin Independent Journal. MediaNews entered into similar partnerships in New Mexico-Texas and Pennsylvania with Gannett, and in Colorado with E.W. Scripps Company. In 2015, Gannett gave its stake in CNP to MediaNews successor Digital First Media in exchange for the New Mexico-Texas and Pennsylvania and cash.Gannett acquires complete ownership of Texas-New Mexico Newspaper Partnership from Digital First Media As MediaNews remains the largest shareholder in the California Newspaper Partnership, the partnership effectively functions as a subsidiary of Denver-based MediaNews Group, and a parent to MediaNews' three newspaper clusters in California, the Bay Area News Group, Los Angeles Newspaper Group and its Northern California holdings.

It functioned as a network of priests and congregations led by Børre Knudsen, Per Kørner and Ludvig Nessa who rejected what they claimed was the liberal direction of the Church of Norway. In 2012/13 the group split into the Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of Norway and independent \\"exile church\\" elect-congregations.  History  The Deanery of Strandebarm (named after the parish and village Strandebarm) was established on Easter Sunday 1991 by priests Børre Knudsen, Ludvig Nessa and Per Kørner. They ordained Kørner, the priest in Strandebarm as dean.\\"Børre Knudsen\\". Norsk biografisk leksikon. The three led the deanery after that, with Knudsen having a particular responsibility for Northern Norway, and Nessa and Kørner for the southern parts of the country. In 1997 priests Arne Thorsen and Olav Berg Lyngmo joined the deanery, and Kørner ordained Knudsen bishop of the \\"Church of Norway in Exile\\". The deanery considered itself as a branch within the Church of Norway that had abandoned the supervision of the Government, the Norwegian Parliament, the Church Meeting, and the Church's officially appointed bishops. It opposed several of the Church's points of view, most importantly on abortion, homosexuality, and re-marriage after a divorce without legitimate reasons. The deanery neither recognised female priests. It supported a complete division of the Church and the Government. The deanery consisted of around ten congregations spread across Norway. Børre Knudsen retired as bishop due to failing health in 2008. In 2012 priest Thor Henrik With was ordained as new bishop for three elect-congregations in Northern Norway, later also for a congregation in Trondheim.Tore Hjalmar Sævik (22 May 2013): Mister presterettighetene Dagen, retrieved 8 August 2013 Kørner and Nessa did not accept With as bishop as they considered his new leadership to represent a softening position on abortion, and continued to lead their own \\"exile church\\" elect-congregations in Western and Eastern Norway.

Playing career Watson started his career playing for his local team in his home parish of Ecclesfield. From there he transferred to Rotherham Swifts in the summer of 1889. The Swifts found themselves in financial difficulties over the course of the season and Watson was sold, along with fellow former Ecclesfield players Rab Howell and Michael Whitham, to recently formed Sheffield United in March 1890. Small, fast and with a hard shot Watson was a regular in the Blades side for the following three seasons as the side first entered The Football League. He played in the test match with Accrington Stanley in 1893, which having won saw the Blades promoted to Division One for the first time in their history. Injuries unfortunately kept Watson sidelined for the entire of the following season but he returned to action by August 1894 and was again virtually ever present for another two years. Having been released by United Watson was signed by West Bromwich Albion with whom he spent two seasons and represented them in The Football League. A season at Lincoln City followed before recurring injuries all but forced him to retire from first team football. He did return to Sheffield United for a further season, offering to play for the reserves without pay with only a benefit match as compensation - an offer United accepted, the game taking place in January 1900.

The Victoria Highway passes through the town, which is the only significant settlement between the Western Australia border and the town of Katherine to the east. Timber Creek is approximately south of Darwin, in an area known for its scenic escarpments and Boab trees. History =Pre-European settlement and exploration= The Ngaliwurru and Nungali Aboriginal people are the original inhabitants and traditional owners of the lands surrounding the town.Australian Broadcasting Corporation \\"Traditional owners win Timber Creek claim\\", 2006 Their way of life remained unchanged for thousands of years until first contact with Europeans in the 19th century.

The party's schooner, Tom Tough, proceeded along the river, landing near the present town of Timber Creek and a base camp for the expedition was established.Travelling Australia information website Gregory named a nearby stream \\"Timber Creek\\" on 24 November while seeking timber to make repairs to the boat.NT Place Names Register Timber Creek Gregory inscribed of the dates of this expedition on a large boab tree near the original campsite, located approximately from the present town; the tree, and the inscription, can still be seen today. =20th century= A police station was constructed in 1898, and substantially upgraded in 1908 as river traffic grew to service pastoral properties being established in the area. In 1911, a depot was established to service the river trade. Historical records from the late 19th and early 20th century indicate there were ongoing tensions, and isolated incidents of violence between pastoralist and Aboriginal residents in the area at during this time. During World War II growing concerns over a Japanese invasion of northern Australia led to the formation of the 2/1st North Australia Observer Unit, a highly mobile reconnaissance unit led by local Aboriginal guides who knew the local landscape. The role of this unit was to report any enemy landings on isolated areas of the coastline.Australia at War 2/1 NORTH AUSTRALIA OBSERVER UNIT (2/1 NAOU) THE \\"NACKEROOS\\" The unit was active in the Timber Creek and Victoria River areas, recognised in 1998 with a memorial to the \\"Nackeroos\\" – the nickname for those who served with this unique unit – being constructed near the town.Victoria Daly Shire Council Timber Creek Timber Creek Traffic passing through Timber Creek increased following the completion of the Ord River Diversion Dam at Kununurra, Western Australia in 1963Ord River Irrigation Scheme and subsequent construction of the road bridge in 1970 across the Victoria River, east of the town, and sealing of the Victoria Highway in 1974.NRETAS Document regarding Victoria Highway Upgrades , Northern Territory Government, 2003 Timber Creek was proclaimed a town on 20 June 1975. In 1996, the Department of Defence purchased Bradshaw Station, a large cattle property in the vicinity of Timber Creek. This land subsequently became Bradshaw Field Training Area, an 8700 km2 live fire training facility. In 2002, the 270m long Bradshaw Bridge opened, providing road access to the training area from the Victoria Highway at Timber Creek.Steelcon Constructions NT Bradshaw Bridge =Griffiths decision= Ngaliwurru and Nungali lands surrounding Timber Creek were the subject of the landmark Griffiths decision in the High Court of Australia. The case (Griffiths v Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment) involved an appeal by the traditional owners, represented by Alan Griffiths and William Gulwin, against the Northern Territory Government's attempted sale in 1997 of vacant Crown land for the purposes of commercial development. In the course of doing so, the native title would be compulsorily acquired under the Lands Acquisition Act 1989 (NT) from the traditional owners by a government Minister, for the commercial benefit of a private third party. Due to a change in government following the 2001 Northern Territory elections, the development did not proceed and the native title was not acquired, but the case proceeded in the courts. The final decision handed down in 2008 found that the provisions under the Lands Acquisition Act meant the Minister could legitimately acquire land for any purpose, extinguishing native title and interests in the land granted under the Native Title Act (1993). By the time of the decision the Northern Territory Government had already changed the legislation to prevent this or future compulsory acquisition of lands subject to native title.Australian Human Rights Commission Native Title Report 2008 Geography =Climate= Timber Creek is a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw) with distinct wet and dry seasons. The annual rainfall is 979mm with the heaviest falls occurring during the wet season months November – April.

It was released as a digital download on September 15, 2011 for the Nintendo Wii via its WiiWare service, March 15, 2012 for iOS devices, and September 26, 2013 for Android. It features both single and multiplayer gameplay. The game also features online leaderboards and challenge levels which are periodically replaced with new ones. Gameplay MotoHeroz is played from a 2D perspective, much like a standard platform game. It differs from a standard platform game in that players will often backtrack or travel in both directions as opposed to the standard linear left-to-right progression. MotoHeroz is a platform racing video game in which the player must guide their vehicle through a colorful environment. Control emphasis is placed on forward and reverse motion and balancing the vehicle. Unlike many a traditional platform game where the player character progresses from left to right, MotoHeroz will often require the player to double back along a previous path which has been altered, or move in a right-to-left reverse direction on a higher platform. Three gameplay modes are included, Story, Online, and Party. Story mode is played by one player as they progress through the game's main campaign. Online play features new levels, challenges and online leaderboards. Up to four players can join in for simultaneous gameplay for Party mode. Fourteen different vehicles are available, and includes over 100 levels. Bonus levels are often interchanged by the developer. Popular levels stay in play longer while those less popular are replaced by new or previous creations. Each level is roughly 20 kilobytes in size, and approximately 50 were created to be interchanged post-launch. Each level remains online for 12–24 hours and features a score-based challenge system. Development, marketing and release MotoHeroz was first announced on September 1, 2010 as an exclusive for the Nintendo Wii. RedLynx would self-publish the game on Nintendo's WiiWare service. It was released for the Wii on September 15, 2011. It was later announced for iOS devices such as the iPhone and iPad via a teaser trailer on March 7, 2012. This version would be published by Ubisoft, who acquired the developer in November 2011. It was released for iOS devices on March 15, 2012, with the iPad version released as MotoHeroz HD. RedLynx Creative Director Antti Ilvesssuo stated that \\"From the start [MotoHeroz] had to be designed for Nintendo’s audience.\\" An interviewer from Edge magazine stated if they felt whether the game would work on other platforms, or whether RedLynx's previous title Trials HD, would be successful on the Wii. RedLynx Chief Executive Officer Tero Virtala stated that \\"I strongly believe that at some point there will be multiplatform launches from us, but those games will have to be such that from the start we feel that it’s going to be an excellent game for every platform.\\" Ilvesssuo stated in a separate interview that MotoHeroz was not intended to be a \\"Trials HD copycat\\", and that the original concept for the game was over five years old at the time. He also re- emphasized the focus on Nintendo's audience, stating \\"With WiiWare, we saw a great opportunity as it suited this type of game very well\\". The game runs at 60 frames per second and features music by Alan Wake composer Petri Alanko. Reception MotoHeroz received \\"favorable\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The Wii version received two perfect scores at Metacritic: from N-Europe's Sam Gittins and Peter Willington of Nintendo Life. David Sanchez of GameZone praised the game's multiplayer aspects. He also noted that until MotoHeroz was released the only reason he found \\"to hook up my console [was] to play Super Smash Bros. Brawl with [his] buddies.\\" He listed the five-hour campaign and lack of online multiplayer as low points to his review, but stated that the game was still well worth its cost. IGNs Lucas M. Thomas gave high marks to several aspects of the game. He noted that the game's load times were extremely fast, the menus were intuitive, and that it had several moments of humor. He also noted that though the Wii cannot produce HDTV resolutions that MotoHeroz still looked impressive in the console's 480p resolution. Darren Nakamura of Destructoid raised a concern with the game's gold medal difficulty. He felt that the challenge ranged \\"from pretty tough to ludicrously difficult.\\" He noted that many critics initially scoffed its price when compared to Trials HD, but stated that most reviewers later recanted their concerns due to large amounts of replay value. Eurogamers Rich Stanton was more critical of the game. He felt that even though it represented some of the best WiiWare games had to offer it still did not stand up to RedLynx's other titles. A higher score was given by Nadia Oxford of Gamezebo. Oxford did note that there are moments of repetitive gameplay, but appreciated the inclusion of randomized online ghost racers for the iOS version. Official Nintendo Magazine Jason Killingsworth stated that MotoHeroz \\"offers countless hours of physics-based fun, especially in chaotic four-player mode.\\" See also *Trials (series) References External links * (Wii) * (iOS) * * Category:2011 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Platform games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in Finland Category:Wii games Category:WiiWare games Category:RedLynx games ","title":"MotoHeroz"},{"id":"35767598","text":"Roland Weitzenböck (26 May 1885 – 24 July 1955) was an Austrian mathematician working on differential geometry who introduced the Weitzenböck connection. He was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Amsterdam in 1923 at the initiative of Brouwer, after Hermann Weyl had turned down Brouwer’s offer. Biography Roland Weitzenböck was born in Kremsmünster, Austria- Hungary. He studied from 1902 to 1904 at the Imperial and Royal Technical Military Academy (now HTL Vienna) and was a captain in the Austrian army. He then studied at the University of Vienna, where he graduated in 1910 with the dissertation Zum System von 3 Strahlenkomplexen im 4-dimensionalen Raum (The system of 3-rays complexes in 4-dimensional space). After further studies at Bonn and Göttingen, he became professor at the University of Graz in 1912. After Army service in World War I, he became Professor of Mathematics at the Karl-Ferdinand University in Prague in 1918. In 1923 Weitzenböck took a position of professor of mathematics at the University of Amsterdam, where he stayed until 1945. He settled in Blaricum, where he became a fully accepted member of the community. He was a man of few words, without observable political views. Appearances are often, however, deceptive, and in this case the solid imperturbable exterior hid a considerable amount of frustration resulting from the disastrous course of the First World War. As so many German and Austrian ex-service men, Weitzenböck became a hard-core revanchist, and an implacable enemy of France. But whereas Brouwer actively campaigned for the rehabilitation of German scientists, Weitzenböck refrained from political activity. However, after the ‘Anschluss’ of Austria in 1938, he started to vent his approval of Hitler’s policies in private conversations. Weitzenböck was elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) in May 1924, but suspended in May 1945 because of his attitude during the war. Weitzenböck had been a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands. In 1923 Weitzenböck published a modern monograph on the theory of invariants on manifolds that included tensor calculus. In the Preface of this monograph one can read an offensive acrostic. One finds that the first letter of the first word in the first 21 sentences spell out: : NIEDER MIT DEN FRANZOSEN (down with the French). He also published papers on torsion. In fact, in his paper \\"Differential Invariants in Einstein’s Theory of Tele-parallelism\\" Weitzenböck had given a supposedly complete bibliography of papers on torsion without mentioning Élie Cartan. Weitzenböck died in Zelhem, Netherlands in 1955. His doctoral students include G. F. C. Griss, Daniel Rutherford and Max Euwe. Publications  *Neuere Arbeiten zur algebraischen Invariantentheorie.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1999. History Side stringer Roadway In 1926, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) improved M-28, by adding several miles of gravel roads and replacing some bridges, including this one over the Tahquamenon River. The department designed the bridge and solicited bids for its constructions. Walter Toebe and Company of Shingleton was awarded the contract to construct the bridge, and built it in 1926 for a cost of $24,286.08. It was listed on the NRHP on November 30, 1999. Historic context The MSHD standardized the designs of steel stringer bridges in 1905–06 and plate girder bridges in 1907–08. However, it was not until 1926, the year this bridge was built, that the department began encasing the steel girder webs in concrete. Why they did so is not entirely clear, and indeed the department abandoned the practice of encasing interior girders soon after. However, they continued encasing the exterior beams in concrete, and continued using the concrete balusters pioneered with this bridge design, and this bridge can be considered a prototype for numerous, similar bridges built by the department in the next decade. The Tahquamenon River Bridge is one of only two remaining bridges of this type in Michigan. Description The M-28–Tahquamenon River Bridge is plate girder bridge built of nine steel girders encased in concrete. The girders are braced by concrete diaphragms and sit on large concrete abutments. The bridge spans , and is wide with a roadway. A concrete deck covered with asphalt sits atop the bridge, and the roadway is lined with concrete guardrails made from fluted balusters and paneled bulkheads.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description The Parker Road–Charlotte River Bridge is a three-panel, rigid-connected Warren Pony Truss bridge; the structural members of the bridge are made pairs of steel angles connected back-to-back, rather than the more traditional box beams. I-beams supporting the wooden deck are bolted to the upright truss. The bridge spans with a width of , and sits on concrete abutments with angled wingwalls. The span has been recently braced with timber pilings in the center, but otherwise is relatively unchanged. The bridge is closed to traffic and is no longer maintained. Historic context In the era before standard bridge designs were drafted by the Michigan State Highway Department, local road commissions were tempted to reduce costs by using lighter two-angle superstructure elements, as in this bridge. This bridge was built in 1914 by the Minneapolis Bridge Company, likely at the behest of the Bruce Township Board. It is the only example of this type of two-angle superstructure truss bridge in Michigan that has been definitively dated.

Danny and Margaret O'Quinn operated the school from 1988 to 2012, and Steve and Tracy Singleton served as Executive Directors from 2012 to 2014. Tim Floyd was named the new Executive Director in March 2015. Beginning in 2017, James Inmon is the director under the title of Headmaster. Still Creek is a therapeutic boarding school that serves neglected and abused children, ages 8-18, from all over The United States by providing a structured, Christian environment in which to live and study. In addition to the academic curriculum, Still Creek offers a variety of vocational training such as welding, agriculture, wood shop, and horsemanship classes. Still Creek students participate in the Brazos County Faith Riders Drill Team, which competes in the annual Texas State 4-H Horse Show. Mission and support The Ranch's mission is to provide for the spiritual, physical, emotional, and academic needs of the residents and students. The Ranch is a non-profit organization that operates on donations from individuals, businesses, corporations, foundations, civic groups, and churches. Donations go toward general operating expenses, including groceries, utilities, and salaries for the staff members. The Ranch relies heavily on three annual fundraisers. Members of the community as well as students from nearby Texas A&M; University volunteer their time helping at the Ranch. History Prior to the coming of the O'Quinns, the land on which Still Creek was built was a children's residential treatment center run by The Answer. When starting the school, Still Creek Ranch leased 14 acres of land that had one school building which had been an old barracks, one building that housed the children, and an old barn. In the first three years, the school served 14 students. With the assistance of staff member Ken Klein, Still Creek shifted its focus away from residential treatment to being a boarding school for underprivileged children. The mission changed to providing a home for children abandoned by their parents. The home's goal was to provide children with structure, discipline, and education in order to become independent adults. Initially, Still Creek served only boys. However, an unidentified benefactor donated 20 acres on the condition that a girls’ home be built on the Ranch. In three years, a girls' home had been built with the help of the Jensen Foundation of Dallas, Texas . Later, the landlord who leased the original 14 acres deeded her entire 100 acres to the Ranch. When the need arrived to build a school building, a four acre lot next to the Ranch came up for sale and a donation was given from a donor in Bryan, Texas that was equal to the sales price. When the foundations to the school were poured, Bibles were placed in each corner. The school was built slowly as donations came in. Volunteers, staff and the boys on the Ranch helped build a mechanic’s shop, a welding shop, a wood shop and horse barns. Every vehicle, piece of furniture, and other furnishings were donated. In 2005, Still Creek bought a 100 acre strip of land with the help of the Jensen Foundation. The land supports oil wells that provide a steady income to the Ranch. Later, a donor bought 15 acres of land adjoining Still Creek Ranch and built a covered horse arena with numerous horse stalls, a kitchen, and bathrooms. In May 2012, Steve and Tracy Singleton took over management at Still Creek while the O'Quinns retired to New Mexico to start a summer camp for abused children. The Singletons were former directors of Happy Hill Farm Academy in Granbury, Texas. In 2013, Still Creek launched Restore Her, a ministry specifically focused on the restoration of minor girls who had either been trafficked or who had been exposed to the commercial sex industry. In 2014, a third girls' house was completed. In March 2015, Tim Floyd was named the new Executive Director of Still Creek Ranch. He and his wife Lori previously served as house parents at the New Mexico Baptist Children's Home. Prior to that, Tim served as the Program Director for Open Door Ministries in Denver, Colorado. Accreditation and Facilities Still Creek Ranch is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and has been accredited since 1991. The school is interdenominational and not affiliated with any particular church. The Ranch has three homes for boys and two homes for girls, a school, staff housing, various shops, and a roofed arena for riding and horse shows. Covering , the arena is among the largest in the region. The school also has a computer lab, science lab, library, weight room, and gymnasium.

Ghali has served as a historic figure and played a key role in the struggle of the Sahrawi people for self- determination and independence from Morocco. He was instrumental in the creation of the Movement for the Liberation of the Saguia el Hamra and Wadi el Dhahab, , the 1970 Zemla Intifada against Spanish rule, the foundation of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro (Polisario Front) in 1973, and the Sahrawi Republic in 1976. He also played a major role in the Western Sahara War and establishment of MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission for the Western Sahara. Biography Ghali was born in Smara, then Spanish Sahara, on 16 September 1949 (although other sources claimed he was born in Bu Craa). Gali joined the Spanish-led Nomadic troops in the late 1960s, and was subsequently dispatched to Smara for administrative work. After several meetings with Mohamed Bassiri and other Sahrawi political leadership, they decided to create the AOLS in 1969, with Gali being the affiliation secretary of the organization. He participated in the AOLS demonstration held in El Aaiun on June 16, 1970, which passed to be known as the Zemla Intifada. Detained that same night by Spanish soldiers, he was sentenced to one year in prison for his political activities. He was freed in 1971, but was briefly detained again in 1972 for taking part in demonstrations. Ghali was one of the original founders and leaders of the Polisario Front in 1973, and was elected as the first General Secretary of the movement at its constitutive congress. Alongside El Uali Mustapha Sayed, Gali led the El-Khanga raid, the first military action of the POLISARIO against a desert post of the Spanish Army, overrunning the position and gathering weapons and equipment. In 1974, as El Uali was elected as the new POLISARIO General Secretary, Gali was selected to command the Sahrawi People's Liberation Army, its military wing. On October 22, 1975, Gali, El Uali and Mahfoud Ali Beiba met General Federico Gómez de Salazar, the Spanish governor of the territory on the first official encounter between representatives of the Spanish government and the POLISARIO. Negotiations broke off shortly thereafter, with Gali do not attending another meeting with Gómez de Salazar on October 29, while the Spanish government declared a curfew on El Aaiun. On 4 March 1976, he was designated as the Defense Minister of the first government of SADR, proclaimed in Bir Lehlou on February 27. He remained in that post until 1989 when he was chosen as Commander-in-chief of the Second Military Region. At an election held on July 9, 2016 in the Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf, Ghali was chosen as the next President and Secretary-General of SADR. Ghali replaced longtime leader Mohamed Abdelaziz, who died on May 31, 2016. Ghali paid a presidential visit to the Nigerian President, President Mohammadu Buhari on Thursday, June 13, 2019, at the villa in Abuja, Nigeria.

Birth  Ulrich I was the eldest son of Reinhard I and his wife Adelaide, who was a sister of Ulrich II, the last Count of Hagen-Münzenberg. He was named after his maternal grandfather, and was the first member of the Hanau family named Ulrich. The date, or even the year of his birth, is unknown.

Reign  Ulrich I inherited the Lordship of Hanau when his father died in 1281. During his reign, he was able to extend his territory considerably. Ulrich acted as a regent for Count Louis of Rieneck-Rothfels. In 1298, he purchased a future interest in the fief that Louis held from Mainz. He probably also acted as regent for his nephews Reinhard and Henry of Weinsberg. = Münzenberg inheritance = Via his morther, Ulrich inherited a 1/6 share of the rich Münzenberg inheritance. His inheritance included a 1/6 share of Münzenberg Castle and the district of Münzenberg, Assenheim, Heuchelheim, Dudenhofen, Münster, Werlachen, Hayn Castle and Dreieich Forest. His mother had brought the district of Babenhausen, including part of the Bachgau and half of Groß- Umstadt into his parents' marriage. Furthermore, his mother inherited Vilbel and 1/4 of Praunheim. His mother's inheritance came with a number of disputes between the heirs. These disputes, or at least Hanau's rôle in them, were largely settled in 1288. The inheritance gave the House of Hanau quite a strong economic position. Several properties could be temporarily added under mortgage arrangenments: Ortenberg with its Castle, Birstein Castle, Orb and Besen-Kassel. These possessions connected Hanau to Steinau an der Straße, which had previously been an exclave, and pulled the upper Kinzig valley into Hanau's sphere of influence. = Settling disputes = Ulrich I secured his position through treaties with his neighbors. In 1290, he ended a long-running dispute with the Bishopric of Würzburg and in 1303, he concluded an alliance with Frankfurt, after some violent arguments. In 1304, he joined a coalition headed by Count Palatine Rudolph I of the Rhine. = Territorial losses = Hanau lost control of the Bachgau area during Ulrich I's reign. Reinhard I had ceded this area to Mainz in 1278. After Archbishop Werner of Eppstein had died, King Rudolph had terminated the fiefs Bachgau and Seligenstat Abbey and handed the administration of these possessions to Ulrich I. In 1292, King Adolph of Nassau promised the Bachgau to the Archbishop, probably as a reward for his vote when Adolf was elected King. Ulrich I ignored this promise, which led to a feud between Ulrich I and Archbishop Gerhard II of Eppstein. Ulrich I was defeated militarily and imprisoned in Bingen. He was released a short time later, however, he had to cede most of the Bachgau. He only retained the villages of Langstadt, Schlierbach and Schaafheim and some scattered rights. For a short period, he pledged parts of his Münzenberg inheritance to the Lords of Falkenstein, who also held a share in the inheritance. Initially he pledged his share of the towns of Münzenberg and Assenheim. In 1303, he also pledged the Jews in those towns and in Nidda, whom the King had pledged to him. He presumably needed the money to participate in a campaign of King Albert I of Germany against the Archbishop of Mainz in 1301/1302. After he repaid the long, a long ownership dispute about these possessions with Lords of Falkenstein began. = Alliance with the King = Ulrich I was very close to the King and participated in a number of the King's military campaigns: * 1277 in the fight against King Ottokar II of Bohemia * 1286 and 1287 against Count Eberhard I of Württemberg * 1288 against Count Reginald of Montbéliard * 1289 against Erfurt * 1294 against Thuringia * 1298 against Albert I of Germany. Albert I won the war after the Battle of Göllheim and Ulrich I was taken prisoner. Ulrich I quickly changed sides, and in 1300 we find him in the entourage of Albert I, who is then King of the Romans. * 1301 and 1302 he took part in a campaign of the new King against the archbishop of Mainz. The King won, and rewarded Ulrich I with the imperial fiefs that had belonged to Gerlach of Breuberg. These possessions were in and around the imperial cities of Frankfurt and Gelnhausen, giving Ulrich a foothold in these cities. He also the right of justice over Gründau and Selbold. * 1305 against Bohemia * 1305 against Count Eberhard of Württemberg again City walls of the Old Town of Hanau Being so close to the King brought advantages for Ulrich's own territory. Four of his towns were granted city rights: * On 5 August 1288, King Rudolph I granted city rights to Windecken (today: part of Nidderau), modeled on those of Frankfurt * On 4 July 1290 Steinau an der Straße was granted a city charter modeled on Gelnhausen * On 28 March 1295 Babenhausen received its city charter, modeled on Frankfurt, from King Adolph I * And finally, on 2 February 1303 the town of Hanau was granted city rights modeled on Frankfurt by King Albert. This included market right and the right to elect a city council presided by two mayors. Serfs could gain their freedom by residing in Hanau for a year and a day (\\" \\"). During this period, the construction of Hanau's first city wall began. = Regional representative of the King = In 1294, abbot Henry V of Fulda was deposed, after he had severely mismanaged his territory. King Adolf appointed Ulrich I as the Fulda's administrator. His reign appears to have been very successful, and he was even able to redeem several mortgages. The greatest success of Ulrich I's policy was his appointment in 1300 as Landvogt of the Wetterau. He retained this post until his death. However, there is very little information of what he achieved as Landvogt. His post was meant to strengthen the King's position in his disputes with the Electors in the Rhine area, who were led by the Archbishop of Mainz. At the request of the King, Ulrich I conquered and destroyed Steinheim Castle, which was defended by Siegfried of Steinheim, a nephew of the Archbishop. His appointment as landvogt provided Ulrich with influence outside his own territory. In particular, he was the first Lord of Hanau to have jurisdict over the Bornheimerberg district, which extended Hanau’s influence to a semi-circle of territory, almost surrounding Frankfurt on the northern side. This district would later be annexed to the Lord’s of Hanau. Ulrich's jurisdiction included important cities, such as Oppenheim, Boppard, Wesel, Frankfurt, Friedberg and Gelnhausen.  Death  Ulrich I died in late 1305 or early 1306. He was buried in Arnsburg Abbey.  Marriage and issue  On 2 October 1272 Ulrich I was engaged to Countess Elisabeth of Rieneck ( - ), the daughter of Count Louis III of Rieneck. At the time, both were children or perhaps teenagers. The actual marriage would take place six years later. This marriage would be very advantageous for the Hanau family, both materially and in terms of status. The background for this marriage was an earlier conflict between the Archbishopric of Mainz and the counts of Rieneck about influence in the western Spessart region. Ulrich's father, Reinhard I, had supported the Archbishop, Werner of Eppstein in this long- lasting conflict and when it was finally decided in Mainz's favour in 1271, one of the conditions of the peace treaty was that Ulrich would marry Elisabeth, and that her dowry would include the city of Steinau an der Straße.Theodor Ruf: Hanau und Rieneck. Über das wechselhafte Verhältnis zweier benachbarter Adelsgeschlechter im Mittelalter, in: Neues Magazin für Hanauische Geschichte, vol. 8, issue 6, p. 300-311, esp. 304 This dowry considerably strengthened Ulrich's position. The exact extent of the dowry can no longer be determined, as the relevant documents are lost. However, there was a problem: the relatives of Ulrich's mother, the Counts of Hagen- Münzenberg were \\"only\\" ministeriales. One condition for the marriage was that she would be raised to proper nobility. On 25 October 1273, King Rudolph I of Germany raised Adelaide as desired. Ulrich I and Elisabeth had the following children: # Ulrich II # Adelaide (first mentioned in 1306 - before 1325), married before 1315 to Lord Conrad V of Weinsberg (before 1301 - 1328) # Conrad (first mentioned in 1343 - after 1352), prebendary of Fulda monastery. In the older literature, there is some doubt that his is really related to the Hanau family. However, his seal includes the coat of arms of Hanau.State Archive in Marburg, document [Nr. 29] of 9 June 1343 The older literature also mentions a Margaret,Helfrich Bernhard Wenck, Hessische Landesgeschichte mit einem Urkundenbuche und geographischen Charten, Bd. 1, Darmstadt 1783, S. 372 who married Count Gerhard of Katzenelnbogen.

In 1912 her parents moved to a large farm in North Bethesda, Maryland, at what later became the Grosvenor Metro station. = Education = Grosvenor was described as intelligent, modest and optimistic, and became one of the first female graduates of the Johns Hopkins University medical program in Baltimore, Maryland. She had earlier studied at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, a liberal arts college for women and one of the oldest of the elite \\"Seven Sisters\\" universities in the United States.

To the right is her name source and grandmother, Mabel Hubbard (Mrs. Alexander Graham Bell), and then her mother Elsie May Grosvenor. Alexander Graham Bell, her grandfather, is rear row, centre. (Courtesy: Bell Homestead National Historic Site) Grosvenor was closely connected to her grandfather by kinship, and professionally as his secretary. She had spent considerable time with him at both the Beinn Bhreagh estate and in Washington, D.C., as well as during his international trips, and was regarded as an authority on Bell to journalists and writers who sought greater detail on the scientist-inventor. Among her early memories of her grandfather were the occasions when the Bells doted on their 10 grandchildren. Pulitzer Prize winner and biographer Robert V. Bruce, author of the most authoritative work on Bell, described him as having \\"the majesty of Moses and the benevolence of Santa Claus.\\" There were many joyful occasions when his grandchildren would sit on his lap and, on command, tweaked the nose of Bell \\"to produce a dog's bark, pulling his hair for a sheep's bleat, and by way of climax, tugging his Santa Clause beard for the deliciously fierce growl of a bear.\\"Bruce 1990, pp.458-459. Grosvenor was a very young witness to a signature event in the Bells' development of flight at Baddeck Bay in 1907, when the Bells' associates launched the Cygnet, an early towed kite experiment of their Aerial Experiment Association. Dr. Bell later wrote: \\"I almost forgot to mention the witness who will probably live the longest after this event (and remember least about it) — my little granddaughter Miss Mabel Grosvenor — 2 years of age.\\" As a secretary and note taker to the scientist she took dictation as he explored genetics, genealogy, telecommunications and marine architecture in the form of the world's fastest boat, the HD-4, a hydrofoil propelled by two of the most powerful aircraft engines and propellers then available. Bell, far ahead of his time in support of social equality and a strong supporter of women's rights, encouraged Grosvenor's mother and grandmother to march in 1913 on the U.S. capital in support of women's right to vote. The suffragist march was 5,000 strong and drew a half-million onlookers, both supporters to the movement as well as threatening detractors. Later in October 1920, Grosvenor accompanied Dr. Bell and her grandmother on her grandfather's \\"farewell visit\\" of Europe, where he searched for long-lost ancestors.Bruce, Robert V. Bell: Alexander Bell and the Conquest of Solitude. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1990, pp.483-484. . They found several cousins he didn’t know existed by scouring genealogical records in Scotland, the land of Bell's birth. Grosvenor was also present when the City of Edinburgh made Dr. Bell a Burgess and presented him with its great honour, its Freedom of The City award.Gray, Charlotte Reluctant Genius: The Passionate Life and Inventive Mind of Alexander Graham Bell, HarperCollins, Toronto, 2006. , .  Alexander Graham Bell Club  The Alexander Graham Bell Club, founded in 1891, became Canada's oldest continuing women's club, and grew out of a social organization started at Beinn Bhreagh by Mabel Bell, Grosvenor's grandmother.

The goal is to identify and treat immediate threats to life that may not have been obvious during an initial assessment. After an initial assessment involving basic checks on airway, breathing and circulation, the caregiver considers things like mechanism of injury (how the person was hurt) to determine if a more rapid diagnostic approach is indicated than might otherwise be used. Indications for rapid trauma assessment Generally, rapid trauma assessment is indicated if: * There was a significant mechanism of injury (for example, a high-speed car accident, falls >20 ft); OR * The patient has an altered mental status; OR * The medical responder suspects that the patient has multi-systems trauma If NONE of these criteria are met, the medical provider may go through a slower or more focused trauma assessment. Identifying life threats A standard rapid trauma assessment will check for each of the following life threats, and provide some forms of basic treatment. Treatment that would not be life-saving is not conducted until after the rapid trauma assessment. For each area of the body assessed, it is helpful to review them while addressing the different parts of the mnemonic \\"DCAP-BTLS.\\" This stands for: Deformities, Contusions, Abrasions, Punctures/Penetrations, Burns, Tenderness, Lacerations, and Swelling. A rapid trauma assessment goes from head to toe to find these life threats: *Cervical spinal injury *Level of consciousness *Skull fractures, crepitus, and signs of brain injury * Airway problems (although these were checked during the initial assessment, they are rechecked during the rapid trauma assessment) such as tracheal deviation *Penetrating trauma to the neck, distention of the jugular veins, or a break in the tracheal-bronchial tree * Signs of serious chest injuries, including penetrating trauma to the chest, which can cause a sucking chest wound; flail chest; tension pneumothorax; and cardiac tamponade * Breathing problems (like airway problems, these are also rechecked during the rapid trauma assessment by listening to breath sounds with a stethoscope) * Signs of serious abdominal injuries, including evisceration; penetrating or blunt force trauma; or peritonitis from bleeding into the abdomen * A fractured pelvis (a person can exsanguinate from a fractured pelvis) * Bilateral femur fractures (a person can also exsanguinate from bilateral femur fractures) * Lower spinal injury or any other trauma to the back See also *SAMPLE history *DCAP-BTLS *Advanced Trauma Life Support References Category:Emergency medical services Category:First aid ","title":"Rapid trauma assessment"},{"id":"35768161","text":"Chahkanduk () may refer to: * Chahkanduk, alternate name of Chahkanan-e Bala * Chahkanduk, alternate name of Chahkandak * Chahkanduk, Birjand * Chahkanduk, Sarbisheh See also * Chahkand (disambiguation) ","title":"Chahkanduk"},{"id":"35768172","text":"Chahkanan-e Pain (, also Romanized as Chāhkanān-e Pā’īn) is a village in Baqeran Rural District, in the Central District of Birjand County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

The ring of invariants is generated by 7 algebraically independent invariants of degrees 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 27 (discriminant) , together with 6 more invariants of degrees 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 21, as conjectured by . discussed the invariants of order up to about 15. The Salmon invariant is a degree 60 invariant vanishing on ternary quartics with an inflection bitangent. Catalecticant The catalecticant of a ternary quartic is the resultant of its 6 second partial derivatives. It vanishes when the ternary quartic can be written as a sum of five 4th powers of linear forms. See also *Ternary cubic *Invariants of a binary form References  * *.

Biography He was the son of celebrated actors William B. Wood and Juliana Westray Wood. In 1827, Wood was a founder and editor of one of the first English-language newspapers in China, The Canton Register, which he printed himself on a hand press donated by James and Alexander Matheson, partners in the trading house Jardine, Matheson & Co.. Starting with the second issue of The Canton Register, Wood began to criticise the censorial policies of the East India Company as well as the \\"despotic and corrupt manner\\" in which the Chinese operated the Canton System of trade. He also expressed strong opposition to the idea that Westerners in China should be subject to the \\"impositions\\" of the Chinese authorities. The powerful East India Company and the resident British community saw such comments as an attack on British trade policy and forced Wood to resign after editing the sixth issue of the newspaper. After a spell in Philadelphia, Wood returned to Canton in February 1831 aboard the American ship Fanny where he joined the trading company Russell & Co. as secretary to William Henry Low, one of the partners. However, Wood lacked business acumen and never achieved monetary success. After leaving Russell & Co, the first edition of Wood's own publication, The Chinese Courier and Canton Gazette came off the presses on July 28, 1831. The title was later shortened to The Chinese Courier in 1832 but the paper succumbed to competition from other periodicals and ceased publication on September 23, 1833 A clever poet, Wood composed parodies of well known poems based on life in Canton, including one by Lord Byron. He was also a skilled draughtsman and caricaturist who offered art lessons to the foreign community and wrote and illustrated his own book, Sketches of China, published in 1830. Wood fell in love with the diarist Harriet Low and frequently visited her home in Macao, ostensibly to give her drawing lessons. When he secretly asked for her hand in marriage, she accepted but her uncle and Wood's employer, William Henry Low objected to his niece marrying a \\"penniless adventurer\\"and forced her to abandon the arrangement. Wood spent the rest of his life as a bachelor. After moving to the Philippines, Wood became manager of a coffee and sugar plantation in Jalajala, Rizal and subsequently joined the office of Messrs. Russell & Sturgis in Manila. He is credited with introducing photography to the Philippines.

The canyon, Anderson Creek, and Anderson Peak () are south of McWay Falls and within the boundaries of Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park. During construction of Highway One in the 1920s and '30s, it was the location of a convict work camp. After the camp closed, literary bohemians like Henry Miller rented the shacks, forming what Miller later called the \\"Anderson Creek Gang\\". The canyon is within the boundaries of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, Sea Otter Refuge, and California condor reintroduction area. The Staude House built in the 1960s sits on a bluff at the mouth of Anderson Canyon above sea level.  Early history  Anderson Trail Pino Palado Peak, the name given the peak during the Mexican era, is said to refer to a tall Ponderosa pine, “peeled” of its bark by a lightning strike, that at one time grew on the southeastern summit. The creek was named after the peak. The modern name is a corruption of the surname of settlers James Andersen, who emigrated from Denmark in 1874 and homesteaded in the canyon, and his brother Peter, who arrived in 1883. The Andersen family had business ties to many of the early settlers in the region, including the Pfeiffers, Slates, and Danis. In the late 19th century a trail was constructed that connected the coast ridge with the coast at Burns Creek, just south of Anderson Landing. Before construction of Highway One, local residents harvested redwood and tanbark, and mined limestone and gold. These resources were shipped out of dog-hole ports located in the region including Saddle Rock Landing at the mouth of Anderson Creek. It was named due to its proximity (.4 miles) to Saddle Rock, a prominent sea shore feature of Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park. The Anderson Canyon region was homestead by Aaron Harlan, located about a mile up the canyon from the mouth of the creek. \\"Pop\\" Ernest Doelter, a Monterey, CA restaurateur who created the abalone steak owned the Saddle Rock Landing for abalone harvesting. Pop's restaurant was a favorite of George Sterling, Jack London, and Andrew Molera.  Highway construction  Anderson Canyon Labor Camp The section of Highway One between Anderson Canyon and Big Sur was completed in October, 1924. In 1926, construction was halted due to lack of funds. and Anderson Canyon was the South end of the road. Construction of the southern portion resumed in 1928, and in 1932, Anderson canyon was selected as the site of the largest labor camp on the coast. From the Anderson Canyon camp, the highway was built south to connect with the road at Big Creek. Anderson Canyon was the last labor camp built. The entire highway was completed and opened on June 17, 1937.  Bohemians  After the Highway was complete, many buildings were left standing on the site from its use as a convict camp. During the 1940 and early 1950s, these cabins were rented out to early Bohemians. Henry Miller lived in a shack in Anderson Canyon from 1944 to 1947. Other residents included avant-garde musician Harry Partch, Emil White, and collagist Jean Varda. Author Elizabeth Smart also lived at Anderson Canyon. Her novella, By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept (1945) may be the first fiction regarding Big Sur's bohemian residents. Miller wrote \\"Into the Nightlife\\" while living there, and he described his fellow artists as the \\"Anderson Creek Gang\\" in Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch. Miller paid $5 per month rent for his shack on the property.  Bluff-top home  In 1965, Tony Staude, former chairman of pharmaceutical wholesaler Bergen Brunswig, and his wife, sculptor Marguerite Brunswig, bought the property. They found abandoned cars and remnants of the convict labor camp, including the former infirmary. They hired Carmel architect George-Brook Kothlow, who had designed other Big Sur dwellings, to design a residence. Staude and his wife had previously been instrumental in designing and financing Chapel of the Holy Cross in Sedona, Arizona. In 1969, they built a two bedroom and two bath circular home, using reclaimed redwood timbers that had formerly used to build a coastal bridge, on the tip of the bluff overlooking the sea. The home became known as the Staude House. After Staude's death in 2006, David F. Brubaker, a former employee of Staude, purchased the home and land. Brubaker applied for a permit to demolish the caretaker house and replace it with a slightly larger home, but never completed the project. The site was used on occasion for weddings. In January, 2014, Brubaker sold the Staude home along with a caretaker dwelling and two studios on two parcels totaling of land for $31,394,000 to Ankle Crisper LLC, owned or represented by attorney Ralph Arnheim of Palo Alto. In 2016, the new owners were granted a permit from Monterey County to demolish the caretaker unit on Parcel A. It extended 13.5 over the property line into the state park. They also removed an accessory unit visible from Highway 1, in violation of the Big Sur Land Use Plan. They built a new residence and a new accessory building east of Highway 1, all outside the critical view shed in which new buildings are prohibited.  Ecology and biology  Anderson Peak is the site of a California condor release site owned by the Ventana Wildlife Society at . In 2006, two condors were discovered nesting in a hollowed out, partially burned redwood tree. These were the first natural birth of a condor in California since 1905. In 2011, PG&E; began a $4.2 million project to bury power lines running from Highway One up Anderson Canyon to Anderson Peak in order to protect condors from potential electrocution. The project involved around of overhead power lines, built in the 1950s, to be removed and installation of an underground replacement line traveling 4,000 feet high. Anderson Canyon is an upland redwood forest. Characteristic species include coastal redwood, California bay, tanbark oak, big-leaf maple, and western sword fern. Wildlife species that may occur in this community include ensatina, Pacific slender salamander, Pacific giant salamander, western-screech owl, Allen's hummingbird, purple martin, acorn woodpecker, Steller's jay, Townsend's western big-eared bat, and pallid bat.  Film credits  Anderson Canyon appears in many films and photoshoots including National Geographic's Big Sur: Wild California, the Richard Burton and Liz Taylor classic The Sandpiper, and more recently in a feature film based on Jack Kerouac's Big Sur. Anderson Canyon also stands in for the Esalen Institute setting in the series finale of the television show Mad Men.

She became active in social life after she moved to Vilnius in 1900 and became known as an energetic and prolific organizer, manager, and treasurer of numerous political, cultural, and charitable organizations. She joined and was one of the leaders of various political parties, including Lithuanian Democratic Party, Peasant Union, and Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union. She was a delegate to the Great Seimas of Vilnius (1905) and was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania (1920) and was considered for the position of Minister of Provision and Public Work (1918) and President of Lithuania (1926). Bortkevičienė organized and ran several charitable organizations, including those supporting gifted students, political prisoners of the Tsarist regime, and deported Prussian Lithuanians. She was also a member of women's movement in Lithuania, being an active member of the Lithuanian Women's Association and the chair of the Lithuanian Women's Union. For her various activities Bortkevičienė was arrested and imprisoned numerous times by different regimes, including Tsarist Russia, independent Lithuania, and Soviet Lithuania. Biography =Early life= Bortkevičienė with her parents and sister She was born in the Manor of Linkaučiai near Krekenava, then Russian Empire, to the family of Juozas Povickas and Antanina Ona Liutkevičiūtė, petty Lithuanian nobles. The family's manor was confiscated for the participation in the Uprising of 1863 and the family moved to Antakalnis village southeast of Ukmergė. Several of her relatives on her mother's side died in the uprising or were deported to Siberia. As a child she visited her deported grandfather and two uncles in Insar. As such, Bortkevičienė grew up surrounded by anti-Tsarist attitudes. She spoke little Lithuanian that she learned from her mother. Her father spoke Polish, but considered himself to be Lithuanian (see Polish-Lithuanian identity). By her own admission, she knew nothing of the Lithuanian National Revival before 1889. She was tutored at home before attending the Marinskaja Girls' Gymnasium in Kaunas in 1885–89. She was expelled from the school for inciting five other girls to disobey a new requirement to pray in an Eastern Orthodox Church, but after much difficulty managed to gain admission to Vilnius Girls' Gymnasium and graduate in 1890. For a year, she studied Polish history and French language at the secret Flying University in Warsaw. Upon her return, she worked at a bank in Ukmergė with her father until his death in 1898. This experience was particularly useful later in life when she organized finances of various organizations. In 1899, she married engineer and childhood friend Jonas Bortkevičius (1871–1909) – he was not of noble birth and her family disapproved the marriage. The newlyweds moved to Vilnius, where they became involved in public life. She studied the Lithuanian language and became passionate about its revival. =Before World War I= Bortkevičienė in 1890s In Vilnius, Bortkevičienė joined an illegal intellectuals' society, later known as the Twelve Apostles of Vilnius. Through book smuggler Motiejus Baltūsis, Bortkevičienė gained access to the illegal Lithuanian newspapers Varpas, Ūkininkas, Naujienos. After Baltūsis's arrest in 1902, she became involved in book smuggling and in publication of these newspapers. She would send manuscripts to the editors and raise money for their expenses. Some of the illegal publications would be hidden in the Church of St. Nicholas. She became a member of central committee the Lithuanian Democratic Party (LDP), established in October 1902, and a member of the board of the Lithuanian Women's Association, established in September 1905. Her home became the gathering place for the intellectuals; sessions of LDP took place in her home. She supported the Revolution of 1905 by providing money, materials, even weapons to agitators. She was a member of the organizational committee of and a delegate to the Great Seimas of Vilnius. The Peasant Union was established during the Seimas and Bortkevičienė became the manager of its central committee. The Union proposed and the Seimas approved a resolution calling for universal suffrage without regard to sex, religion, or nationality. According to memoirs of her contemporaries, she spoke little but was involved in nearly every aspect of organizing and running the Seimas. She assisted Ernestas Galvanauskas in his escape from the Panevėžys Prison and flight abroad. In 1906, the revolution was weakening and Bortkevičienė's work shifted to the Lithuanian press which became legal. She published Lietuvos ūkininkas and Lietuvos žinios. In September 1907, Bortkevičienė participated in the First Lithuanian Women's Congress and later attempted to prevent the split within women's movement to Catholic and liberal branches. She was also involved in charitable work, including Žiburėlis society which supported gifted students (Bortkevičienė was its chair from 1903 to 1940) and Martyr Fund (Kankinių kasa) which supported activists persecuted by Tsarist authorities (1904–14). For her anti-Tsarist activities, she was imprisoned four times. She was arrested for the first time in 1907 for participating in an illegal teacher gathering. Her husband was imprisoned in Lukiškės Prison in 1906 for three months; the experience weakened his health and after a long treatment he died in January 1909. Before the illness, he had a well-paid job at a military factory. She used inheritance from him (about 5000 rubles) to fund the publication of Lietuvos ūkininkas and Lietuvos žinios. In 1915, she became the first female Freemason in Lithuania. =During the war= Bortkevičienė (sitting center) at the Lithuanian conference in Stockholm in 1917 During World War I, Bortkevičienė evacuated to Russia and continued her active public work. She took up to organize relief for Prussian Lithuanians deported from Lithuania Minor. She visited their communities in towns along the Ural Mountains and Volga River. The journey took five months. Her organization, the Lithuanian Care (), provided support to some 4,000 Prussian Lithuanians, maintained six elementary schools and four shelters for the elderly. In April 1917, Lithuanians decided to organize the Lithuanian conference in Petrograd. Bortkevičienė was a member of its organizing committee and, during the conference in May 1917, a member of its Education Commission. During the conference, she opposed full independence of Lithuania and instead advocated for autonomy within the Russian Empire. Within few months she regretted the vote and considered it a mistake. She became treasurer of the newly formed Lithuanian Popular Socialist Democratic Party. In October 1917, she was a delegate of the Lithuanian conference in Stockholm. After the conference, she lived in Copenhagen and worked with the Red Cross organizing relief for Lithuanian POWs in Germany. In spring 1918, she returned to Vilnius and resumed political activities, reviving Lietuvos ūkininkas in November 1918. In December 1918, at the start of the Lithuanian–Soviet War, the Lithuanian government was in crisis and Bortkevičienė encouraged Mykolas Sleževičius to take charge and become the Prime Minister. Sleževičius considered her for the Minister of Provision and Public Work, but members of the government expressed reservations about a woman minister and she was not selected. While the government evacuated to Kaunas, Bortkevičienė stayed in Vilnius. In the beginning of 1919, Bortkevičienė and other prominent personalities, including Mečislovas Reinys, , and Liudas Gira, were jailed as hostages by the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic headed by Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas. Lithuanian SSR demanded release of communists held by the Lithuanian government. She spent six months in prisons in Lukiškės, Daugavpils, and Smolensk. On 24 July, Vaclovas Sidzikauskas arranged prisoner exchange in Daugailiai: 15 prominent Lithuanians, including Bortkevičienė, for 35 communists. =After World War I= In July 1919, Bortkevičienė returned to Kaunas. In April 1920, as a candidate of the Peasant Union, she was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania, but due to her busy schedule she refused the mandate. She became a member of the Constituent Assembly in January 1921 when she replaced deceased Juozas Lukoševičius. She helped to prepare the Statute of the University of Lithuania and Patient's Fund Law. The law was particularly important for women as it provided 6-week maternity leave and forbade termination of employment on grounds of pregnancy. During the Assembly sessions Bortkevičienė spoke rarely, but she voiced her opinions on two major issues: land reform and the institution of the president. She opposed returning land that was confiscated by the Tsarist regime from churches and monasteries. When discussing the constitution, she also opposed creating the institution of the president. Both of these measures passed by the votes of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party. In 1926, she ran in the parliamentary election as a candidate of the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union. She was not elected to the Third Seimas of Lithuania, but she was nominated to the President of Lithuania. She received one vote. Bortkevičienė (in the middle) looks at the printing press destroyed by the explosion 1927 In April 1920, together with the Lithuanian Popular Socialist Democratic Party (LPSDP), she established publishing company AB Varpas (bell) that she headed until 1930. Because LPSDP shared office space with the press, in effect, she was in charge of the finances and daily operations of LPSDP. In February 1922, she revived the publication of Lietuvos žinios and Lietuvos ūkininkas. The publications were outspoken about their ideals and did not shy from criticism of the government for which Bortkevičienė faced fines and arrests. In 1923 alone there were 17 lawsuits where Bortkevičienė was named as the responsible party. For publishing a caricature of Prime Minister Vytautas Petrulis and Minister of Defense Leonas Bistras in October 1925, she was fined 2,000 litas or imprisonment for 1.5 months. Not having enough funds, she was imprisoned until her friends raised enough money. All her life Bortkevičienė campaigned for democratic liberties and was particularly upset by the December 1926 coup d'état that brought the authoritarian regime of Antanas Smetona. Her publications were critical of the regime either directly or indirectly (for example, via examination of negative effects of other authoritarian regimes). On 11 March 1927, the printing house was bombed by unknown persons, most likely members of the fascist Voldemarininkai movement; she lived in a small house near the printing house. The explosion was powerful enough to collapse two floors of the building and destroy printing presses. However, the newspaper was not discontinued – the same day Lietuvos žinios was printed by a different press. Bortkevičienė rebuilt the press by October 1928. The publication of Lietuvos žinios was temporarily suspended by the government censors four times; the last and the longest time was six months for making fun of a son of Benito Mussolini. Bortkevičienė campaigned for amnesty of Juozas Pajaujis who received a death sentence for organizing an anti-Smetona coup in 1927. In 1922, she helped reestablish the Lithuanian Women's Union which she chaired until 1928. She was also a member of other women's organizations, including Lithuanian Women's Support Committee and Association of Lithuanian Women with Higher Education. She also participated in the establishment of the umbrella organization Lithuanian Women's Council in 1928, but became its opponent when the Council became financed and used as a political tool by the Smetona's regime. When Soviet Union occupied Lithuania in 1940, the press was nationalized taking away Bortkevičienė's life work and means of living. In 1945, she was arrested and interrogated by NKVD several times. That negatively affected her health and she died in October 1945 in Kaunas. Her funeral was supervised by NKVD; her body was transported in a simple truck to Troškūnai and buried next to her sister.

Luckett starred at the prep level for Kolbe High School in his hometown of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and played college basketball for the Ohio Bobcats between 1972 and 1975. Following his junior season at Ohio, he declared for the 1975 NBA draft where he was selected by the Detroit Pistons. Luckett played for one season in the Eastern Basketball Association (EBA) with the Long Island Sounds and was named Rookie of the Year in 1976. High school Growing up, Luckett honed his talents at Nanny Goat Park in Bridgeport. As an eighth-grade student he once scored 59 points against another high school's junior varsity team. This scoring outburst previewed what Luckett would do at Kolbe Boys High School—establish a record-setting career that saw him score more points than any other high school player in New England history, win a state championship, and get named the national high school player of the year as a senior in 1971–72. Throughout his four-year varsity career, Luckett scored 2,691 points, which as of 2012 is still the highest total in the New England region history. In one game during his sophomore season, he scored 53 points against an opponent, and for his career he averaged 31.1 points per game. As a junior, Luckett led Kolbe to a state championship victory. Then, as a senior, he averaged a triple-double of 39.5 points, 16 rebounds and 13 assists per game en route to being named the national high school player of the year. His great success early on has been attributed to his hard work ethic and the fact that he grew up with, and played every day against, Frank Oleynick and Barry McLeod, both of whom were later drafted to the NBA (although only Oleynick played in any games). College Toward the end of high school, Luckett suffered a freak knee injury. It was not serious enough to sideline him from playing his freshman year at Ohio University, but it would later prove to be the undoing of any professional career. In 1972–73, his first year at college, Luckett was featured on the cover of the November 27 issue of Sports Illustrated during the first week of his Bobcat career. He was a confident freshman, proclaiming that he would \\"drive those rascals wild\\" when referring to the Missouri Tigers, his first college opponent. After a 3-for-12 shooting performance against them and a rough introduction to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I basketball, Luckett found his groove and ended up averaging 13.5 points per game for his freshman season. The following season, Luckett averaged 22.8 points per game and led the Mid- American Conference (MAC) in scoring. The Bobcats earned a berth in the 1974 NCAA Tournament after winning the conference championship. For his efforts he was named the MAC Men's Basketball Player of the Year. In 1974–75, Luckett's junior season, he increased his scoring average to 25.2 points per game, bringing his career average to 20.5. He earned numerous All-America honors, becoming just the second player from Ohio University to do so. For the second consecutive year he led the league in scoring and repeated as a First Team All-MAC performer. Luckett decided to turn professional after the season, forgoing his NCAA eligibility and hoping to become the next NBA star. He scored 1,625 points in just three seasons, which was the most in school history at the time. Later life Luckett was selected in the 1975 NBA Draft by the Detroit Pistons. Following the draft, Luckett gained even further notoriety for scoring 28 points in a game against a team that had players like Julius Erving and Earl Monroe on its squad. This game ultimately became the highlight of his post-collegiate basketball career, however, because he re- injured his knee while walking up an escalator. He could not run or even lift his leg, and thus was cut by Detroit prior to ever playing a game in the league. He went back home to Bridgeport, now with his high school sweetheart- turned-wife, and within a year enrolled at the University of Bridgeport. He finished his undergraduate degree at the school, and for the first several years after graduation he played semi-professional basketball on top of working full-time in business. His company, Unilever Home and Personal Care, paid for his Master of Business Administration (MBA) that he earned at the University of New Haven. Luckett eventually became the company's manager of community relations, then after 25 years he retired. Today he resides in Hamden, Connecticut with his wife Valita.

Background EastWest Studios was first known as Western Studio, one half of the United Western Recorders studio complex located on 6000 and 6050 West Sunset Boulevard. In 1984, United Western Recorders was sold and renamed to Ocean Way Recording. In 1998, the former Western Studio half at 6000 Sunset was divided from Ocean Way Recording, sold, and renamed to Cello Studios. In 2005, Cello Studios ceased operation. On January 17, 2006, Doug Rogers acquired ownership of 6000 Sunset. Rogers commissioned designer Philippe Starck (SLS Hotel Los Angeles, St. Martins Lane hotel, London) to refurbish and redesign the artist lounges, kitchen, and reception areas, which had previously suffered water damage. Careful to preserve the integrity of the original recording facilities, Starck and Rogers implemented a brand new design to create “a place where artists can meet, mingle, and be inspired.” The studio complex became Starck’s first and only recording studio design. In March 2009, the renovated studios, renamed EastWest Studios, opened to the public. Since then, its clients have received over 120 Grammy nominations from recordings made in EastWest Studios, more than any other studio in the world.

First described by Martens and Galeotti in 1842 under the previously used name Asplenium parvulum, the species was given its current, valid name by Kunze in 1844. Several similar species are known from the tropics; A. resiliens may have arisen from these species by reticulate evolution, but precise relationships among the group are not yet certain. Description It is a small fern with pinnate fronds, growing in erect tufts, with a shiny black stipe and rachis (stem and leaf axis). Sterile and fertile fronds are similar in appearance. The roots are thin and wiry and do not proliferate to form new plants. The rhizome is short and erect, about in diameter. It has variously been described as sometimes branching or unbranched. It bears stiff filamentous, linear, or lance-shaped scales, which are blackish in color and obscurely clathrate (bearing a lattice-like pattern) or entirely black. The scales are long and wide, with untoothed, often brown, margins and long, drawn-out tips. Leaves are erect and borne in dense clumps, varying in size from long and from wide. The stipe (the stalk of the leaf, below the blade) is straight and stiff and a glossy black to purplish-black in color. It may be smooth or bear scattered blackish-brown, threadlike scales long and tan, club-shaped hairs long which are appressed (lie flat against the stipe). The stipe measures long (rarely as long as ), and comprises one-tenth to one-quarter or one-third of the length of the blade. It is round in cross- section but slightly flattened adaxially and has indistinct wings on either side, or lacks them entirely. The leaf blade is linear in shape, sometimes slightly wider below the tip or just above the base. It measures from long and from wide, sometimes as wide as . It abruptly converges to a lobed, pointed tip and gradually tapers at its base. Unlike the related Palmer's spleenwort (A. palmeri), it does not form proliferating buds at the tip; however, the pinnatifid is often deciduous, leaving behind a naked rachis. The blade is hairless or bears scattered club-shaped hairs, long, beneath. The leaf tissue is often bluish-green and thick in texture, not quite leathery. The rachis, like the stipe, is rounded, blackish and shiny; it may be smooth or have a few of the tan hairs found on the stipe. The winging of the stipe extends up the rachis; it is variously described as taking the form of parallel, cartilaginous ribs, with a narrow, green, leafy wing, the ribs fusing into a wing towards the tip of the leaf, or a whitish to tan wing similar in dimensions to that of the stipe. The blade is cut into pinnae throughout its length, from 20 to 40 pairs per leaf. The pinnae are sessile (stalkless) or have minute stalks and are rectangular in shape, tapering slightly toward the tip. In North American and Mexican material, those in the middle of the leaf blade measure from in length (rarely as small as ) and from in width. In Guatemalan material, the pinnae typically measured from in length and from in width, the ratio of length to breadth being typically 1.5 to 2.5. Each pinna usually has an auricle at its base, pointing towards the tip of the blade; occasionally auricles pointing towards the base of the blade are also present. The edges of the pinnae are untoothed or have shallowly rounded teeth (or deep, rounded teeth in exceptional shade-grown specimens), and are often rolled under. The tips of the pinnae are blunt. The lower pinnae are widely spaced on the rachis, and reflexed downwards. Leaf veins are free (they do not rejoin one another) and are difficult to see; fertile veins are once-forking and do not terminate in hydathodes (prominent swellings). Fertile pinnae bear 2 to 6 pairs of sori (rarely as few as 1 pair or as many as 10), about in length, on both sides of the midrib; the sori are crowded at the edges and often merge as they age. The indusia covering them are from long (rarely to ) and from wide, greenish or pale yellowish to whitish in color and opaque, with straight or slightly jagged edges. They are persistent after the spores mature, but may be hidden by the full sporangia. A. resiliens has a chromosome number of n = 2n = 108 and produces 32 unreduced, round or egg-shaped spores per sporangium. =Similar species= A. resiliens resembles several of its congeners; in particular, it belongs to a group comprising varicolored spleenwort (A. heterochroum), 'A. nesioticum, and A. palmeri, as well as A. resiliens. The members of this group all share dark, lustrous stipes and lack prominent hydathodes on the surface of the blade, the latter characteristic distinguishing them from single-sorus spleenwort (A. monanthes) and others. Among the group, A. resiliens has a slightly more leathery leaf texture than the rest, lacks distinct teeth on the pinna margins, and tends to have once- forked, rather than simple, fertile veins. Stolze noted that specimens with leaf texture so thick as to obscure the veins may be identified as A. resiliens, as A. heterochroum and A. palmeri very rarely become this leathery. In the more temperate parts of its range, A. resiliens may be confused with ebony spleenwort (A. platyneuron) and maidenhair spleenwort (A. trichomanes). Its stipe and rachis are darker and its pinnae smaller and more rounded than that of A. platyneuron, which also displays frond dimorphism with prostrate sterile fronds. The pinnae of A. resiliens are more widely spaced than those of A. trichomanes, which also lack the upward-pointing auricle, the texture of the leaf tissue is more leathery, and the stipe darker. A hybrid between A. resiliens and A. heterochroum, Morzenti's spleenwort (A. heteroresiliens), is found in Florida and the Carolinas. As A. resiliens is triploid and A. heterochroum is tetraploid, the hybrid is pentaploid and reproduces apogamously. The hybrid is difficult to distinguish from the parental species, being intermediate in morphology; its fertile veins are sometimes less forked than in A. resiliens, its leaves tend to have more toothed edges, and it bears misshapen sterile spores together with large, globose, unreduced spores. In A. resiliens, the sori are close to the pinna margin; in A. heteroresiliens, they are slightly closer to the margin than to the costa. Taxonomy The species was described from Mexico in 1842 by Martin Martens and Henri Guillaume Galeotti. However, the name they chose, Asplenium parvulum, had already been used, rendering their name a later illegitimate homonym. It was first described under its valid name, A. resiliens, by Gustav Kunze in 1844. He did not discuss the reason for his choice of epithet, although it may refer to the springy character of the stems. In 1848, Kunze assigned North American material of A. resiliens the name A. trichomanoides, believing it to be the plant described under that name by André Michaux; in fact, Michaux's material was ebony spleenwort, and in any case the name A. trichomanoides was preoccupied and invalid. W. J. Hooker considered it a variety of ebony spleenwort, giving it the name A. ebeneum var. minus in 1860, but others continued to maintain it as a separate species; Eaton refers to it as \\"little ebony spleenwort\\". Oliver Atkins Farwell transferred it to a segregate genus as Chamaefilix resiliens in 1931, but this name was never widely accepted. In 1940, A.H.G. Alston described material from Argentina, previously identified with A. trichomanes, as a new species, A. lealii, which he named for its collector, Adrián Ruiz Leal. He noted that this species resembled A. resiliens, but had fewer hyaline cells on the scale margins. This species is now treated as a synonym of A. resiliens. A study based on nuclear and plastid genetic markers, using material from the United States, Mexico, and Costa Rica, showed that A. resiliens forms a clade with A. palmeri and specimens resembling A. heterochroum. Within this clade, the latter two formed a sister clade to A. resiliens. Plastid markers indicated that the A. resiliens clade was divided into two separate groups, while nuclear markers from two distinct groups were distributed among the samples, with five specimens carrying markers from both groups, and one specimen each carrying markers from only one of the groups. This suggests that A. resiliens developed by reticulate evolution, i.e., as the descendant of a hybrid between two taxa, each parental taxon carrying the one of the two groups of plastid and nuclear makers. In addition, of two specimens, one morphologically identified as A. resiliens, and one as A. palmeri, both were found to contain a nuclear marker from the A. resiliens clade and another from the A. palmeri clade. While apogamous specimens of A. palmeri are known, it is typically a sexually reproducing species, and the implication of these specimens is unclear. Distribution and habitat Asplenium resiliens is found in the southern United States, Mexico, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Guatemala, and South America from Colombia and Venezuela south to northern Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. Within the United States, it is found from Florida west to Arizona and southern Nevada and north to south- central Pennsylvania. It is found throughout most of Mexico, but is most abundant in the northeast, in Nuevo León and Coahuila. In Guatemala, it is known from the western departments of Huehuetenango, El Quiché, and Sololá. In Argentina, its distribution follows the arc of the mountains from Jujuy Province southward to the Sierra de la Ventana in Buenos Aires Province; it is also known from Mendoza Province, in the west of the country, from the departments of Las Heras and Luján de Cuyo. It is found on or at the base of cliffs or sinkholes, on limestone or other alkaline rocks, although specimens have also been reported from crevices in granite and sandstone. Growth on soil is rare. It may be found in forests or on boulders, ledges, and in crevices of cliffs. Plants grow at altitudes ranging from (in North America) to (in Guatemala). Plants at the higher altitudes ( and above) are stunted and more compact than usual, with leaves long and overlapping pinnae a few millimeters in length. These differences (observed in Guatemalan and Peruvian material) are believed to be due to environmental factors rather than any taxonomic distinction. Ecology and conservation Asplenium resiliens is a triploid and reproduces apogamously, producing 32 spores per sporangium. Specimens with 64 well-formed spores per sporangium, believed to be sexually reproducing, were collected from Green Gulch in the Chisos Mountains in 1937, although other specimens since collected in the area have the typical 32 spores per sporangium. While globally secure, it is considered an endangered species in many of the states at the northern edge of its North American range. NatureServe considers it to be critically imperiled (S1) in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Utah, imperiled (S2) in Kansas and North Carolina, and vulnerable (S3) in West Virginia. It has become extinct in Louisiana since the limestone caprock of a salt dome at Winnfield, the only location for the fern in the state, was quarried away. It is also believed to be extinct in Ohio, where it was last collected in 1900, although suitable habitat still exists in the state. Quarrying of the calcareous rocks on which it grows poses a \\"low- level\\" threat to the species. Cultivation Asplenium resiliens is tolerant of cold to USDA hardiness zone 6. It prefers moist conditions, a basic potting soil, and a medium amount of light.

It provides the ability for client-server programs to be delivered in a lightweight manner via web browsers, and provides synchronization for multiple users to interact with common objects and environments. For example, using VWF, a developer can take video lesson plans, component objects and avatars and successfully insert them into an existing virtual or created landscape (such as EDGE\\"US Army's Edge Program Leveraging Bigworld\\" or Open Sim), interacting with the native objects and users via a VWF interface.“Virtual World Framework homepage” VWF further opens the door to interface different training content, simulations, objects, users and locations; which will extend and expand the scope of training and education. (Imagine running a tank simulation with aviation assets, provided by two different simulations suites, but executed together and passing imagery and sensor data between them, working over a common landscape and feeding a constructive mapping simulation run on a third platform, all seamlessly and transparent to remote users via their browsers). The VWF is meant as a useful tool to interact with differing types of entities (objects, avatars, simulations, spaces). As an open-source tool protected under the Apache II license, VWF is free and accessible to any number of developers who can create content and expand its scope and functionality. The VWF delivers its interactivity using the web, creating an opportunity to align mismatched objects or environments. VWF is under development to work with Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG) such as EDGE, and ideally will be developed to interface with the latest object encodings (such as Unity and MP4), environments (such as OpenSim MOSES) and other simulations platforms in order to create a truly agnostic interfacing tool.  Myths  Even though it has a suggestive name, the VWF is not a virtual world. Nor is it a virtual world generation tool. Can the VWF produce a virtual space and content to fill it? Yes, it can, and it absolutely can be used to provide additional objects and interactions to augment/interact with entities to which it connects. VWF isn’t a simulator. The VWF is meant to extend the use of active client-server simulations in order that they can be accessed via a web browser. It is also meant to add extra dimensions to existing simulations or to create simulation content to add to an existing virtual space (such as MOSES) or a spontaneously generated space. The VWF has the capability to create fully functional simulations but is not meant to be a complete simulator on its own. VWF is not an avatar, nor does it require an avatar to run. The VWF does not require a virtual space in order to work; it can be used to generate a virtual space within the web browser or locally on the host machine. The VWF does not need an avatar to function, and does not necessarily generate avatars for use with virtual worlds, but can be used to produce or interact with avatars.  Raison d'etre  The United States Department of Defense (DoD) cannot continue to do business as usual. In FY05, the DoD spent $9.1B in Modeling and Simulation related activities. Approximately 40% of that budget was used for simulators, war gaming, and modeling.IDA Model & Simulation Study, R. Rolfe and R. Atwell, October 20, 2005 The vision of the VWF is to reduce the funding used to support M&S; activities in direct support of pressure to reduce spending and increase efficacy of existing / emerging technology.“Army Goes World of Warcraft to cope with Spending Cuts in M&S; Training” The DoD needs a tool to tie together its myriad, stove-piped, specialty simulations solutions. It needs a tool to extend and expand its ability to train an increasing number of personnel across ever-widening distances. DoD stresses a need to reduce and reuse technology and to find more cost-efficient means to provide the most advanced technological and pedagogical systems of training. It’s not just about training DoD personnel however. We are surrounded by immersive, personalized social media and technology (such as Smart Phones, Facebook, Twitter, Pandora Radio, Project Glass and augmented reality sites such as Layar). Traditional education systems do not allow for the pace of information sharing and immersion that media, games and the internet provide to youth on a regular basis and modernization/customization of education is becoming absolutely essential to its effectiveness.“Digital Shift to Augmented Reality in the Classroom” The intersection of technologies and the speed/volume of data delivery create a perfect storm of possibility for this system to provide the most good at the best cost. As with the Internet, which started out as ARPAnet, the VWF is intended to develop into an open, robust platform that revolutionizes how we perceive and interact with the world. With the VWF and the use of mobile / web enabled devices, users will be able to interact with their world on a grand scale; VWF capitalizes on the same technologies that enable 3D apps to view augmented reality, and will port their capabilities via the web on a large scale.[This is a forward-looking statement based on the vision of the creators, and is not a statement of fact at this time]  Intended audience  The VWF is for developers of simulations, education systems, training content, games, information sharing, private individuals, really anyone with an interest in sharing information with multiple users in a lightweight fashion using a web browser as a delivery mechanism. The VWF is for users to be able to access information, training, or content no matter where they are or what their hardware or bandwidth restrictions may be, as long as they have a secure link to the training server through the internet. The VWF is to provide rapidly available content to those who need it most, when they need it, in a fashion which is accessible and low-overhead.  Significance for business and government  VWF means a massive savings in preventing redundancy, in linking different systems and in building economies of scale and scope. It means access to unprecedented complexity of training content and a huge flexibility in its delivery. It means faster and more thoroughly trained personnel. It means platform-independent computing solutions for passing any type of data quickly and efficiently. It means highly adaptive, rapid prototypes independent of the platforms which created them. It means staying at the forefront of the computing trends in information sharing.“Towards Platform Independent Adaptive Session Mobility”, ACM Digital Library It means a rapid means of generating customized training solutions. It means spontaneous meeting spaces and a method for delivering increased complexity and speed of intelligence to those who need it.  Ownership and licensing  = Ownership = The DoD owns the rights to the source code of the VWF; however, as it is licensed using Apache II, it is freely usable by any and all as long as original attribution is given to the creators.http://www.defensenews.com/print/article/20120127/TSJ01/301270004/New- Tool-Aims-Slash-Costs-Creating-Virtual-Worlds = Licensing = The framework is licensed under the Apache II license, which essentially states that the user of the software is granted a royalty-free license to use, modify, and sell derivative works of, the software as long as the original license and attribution file(s) are included in the distribution of any and all subsequent works. The original work is licensed “as is” and contains no warranties of any kind. = Content rights = Content rights are managed via the provisions contained in the Apache 2 license. The current content version control is affected by the primary engineers through github, with the latest stable builds published under unique serial numbers. = Designers = The designers are David A. Smith (computer scientist) (Lockheed Martin Chief Innovation Officer – project oversight, design, architecture), David Easter (LM Engineer - Development/Architecture), Richard Boyd (Lockheed Martin Virtual world Labs Chief Architect - governance and ecosystem design), Allison Corey (LM Engineer – development), Scott R. Haynes (LM Engineer - Development), Michael J. Vacirca (LM Engineer - Development), Steven D. Carr (LM Engineer - Development), Cynthia L. Moore (contractor, OSD(P&R;) TRS – design, future specs, governance), Carlton Rosengrant OSD(P&R;) TRS – overall Program Manager, Frank C. DiGiovanni (Director, OSD(P&R;)TRS),“Frank C. DiGiovanni, Director, Training Readiness & Strategy” Coles/RDECOM (Edge interfacing), Robert Chadwick (ADL – code efficiency and applications), and emerging partners as new functions and libraries are proposed. = Contributing = VWF is posted on github,“Virtual World Framework github” and is open to any and all developers who wish to contribute forks, projects, suggestions or build- outs for the framework. The original creators especially seek major platform developers who wish to add interfacing to their platform for use with VWF, such as MMOs, simulations designers, terrain mapping providers, 3D modeling, virtual landscapes, etc. The paper \\"A Virtual World Ecosystem Framework\\", presented at the IITSEc conference in 2012, explains the philosophy of contribution to the system.http://ncnewschools.org/2012stemconference/CONF_PDFs/The_Virtual_World_Ecosystem_Framework.pdf  Development path  = Evolution = The VWF is managed via github and developer inputs through a loose consortium of the original creators. In time, the community will stand up a non-profit governing organization, in order to conduct full-time partnerships and version control of the software. Through the use of the latest codecs, interfacing partnerships with major content, object and texture providers, and a persistent location, it is additionally the goal of the creators that VWF will evolve into the standard for interfacing content with users on the web. = Availability to web applications = The VWF is available for use in web applications, and there are a few minor applications/demonstrations already constructed as proofs of concept. and can be found in the public directory As the community extends the robustness of the VWF, increases the libraries and finalizes the toolkits, these applications will gain in complexity as well. Developers are welcome to construct web applications with the existing code and examples. There is nothing special required to run completed applications outside of having access to a compatible browser with WebGL and potentially web sockets capability depending on the location of the source objects and interactions. = A framework among frameworks = There are many applications available which advertise themselves as Thin Clients or web interfaces. There are no open source development tools in widespread use that interface different entities in a persistent, secure manner using a thin client through web- browsers.“Platform Independent Computing”. This article was written in 2006 and search results display few successful efforts that are not highly specialized, do not involve significant plug-ins, client-side obligations for processing, or lag to date While there are many tools available, many of them are highly specialized and require proprietary software installed on both the client and server side. There are still other tools which produce virtual environments, avatars, and content, but none of the ones known tie them together, spontaneously create interfaces among them or provide seamless communications to all of the entities regardless of their timing and without a heavy burden in bandwidth or processing power for the client. VWF does this and will do more as it continues its evolution. VWF utilizes web sockets and WebGL, directly providing a content link between entities and build 3D objects in the quickest, most efficient manner possible. Other virtual interfacing programs utilize Flash which also provides direct content, but does so in a less efficient manner. = Additional resources = VWF information is available on two sites: Virtual World Framework Homepage (mirrored on vwf mirror site) and github (search virtual-world-framework).  VWF applications  = Training tsks & timeline = VWF can be applied to content to train on most tasks which do not require solely live training. Specifically: Curriculum facilitated through simulations, classroom training, augmented reality, mixed media training, and games are the ideal candidates for VWF. Augmented reality content delivered to classrooms, or augmented additions to mobile devices such as this one Also simulations which combine live training with simulated content are good candidates for VWF. The complexity of the training and the number of trainees largely dictates the date by which this VWF capability will be delivered. For delivery of classroom-type training the VWF is capable of being used to develop content. For simulations-type training, following the persistence and synchronization elements of the VWF being developed in the next 6 months (by fall 2012), this capability of the VWF should be possible. For augmented reality and truly immersive gaming, VWF will be under development with critical partners and hopes to have this capability in the coming 24 months, depending on current technologies and partnerships. = LVC exercises = Ideally, VWF will be used in live, virtual, and constructive simulation (LVC) exercises as a primary or secondary delivery mechanism. LVC is ideal for VWF delivery due to its large virtual/digital component and its need to be delivered to myriad audiences in a variety of locations/platforms. = Live training & VWF = Live objects such as aircraft, weapons and vehicles will pass data to the simulator through sensors (read off of the radar/weapons/sensors on the live equipment directly into the simulation and then the input/output data passed through VWF to the myriad participants), data streaming through interfacing servers (in the case of personnel/equipment trackers such as Blue Force Tracking) and through information injection through constructive simulations (such as placing live units on a map and manually tracking their status/positions). = Constructive simulation & VWF = Simulations do not take place “in” the Virtual World Framework. The VWF is a tool to help interface different entities.“Virtual World Framework Homepage About section” constructive simulations, in which simulated people operate simulated systems, are stimulated using human inputs. Ostensibly the VWF would provide the interface (via the web) for some or all of these humans who would be inputting data into the system, then would receive the simulation results from the program executing on the server machine/cloud/locally-determined- host, and would display the results in some fashion via web interface. = Required tools to use the VWF = Developers use the VWF to build simulations using Java script and functionality provided through the VWF. The VWF generates the appropriate display and manipulation files at the time of compilation. As the VWF develops a construction environment will be developed in order to allow users to drag and drop content and manipulate it, greatly reducing production time/complexity. This environment is under construction, and is anticipated to be completed at the end of 2012.  Security considerations  = Web security issues = The web is agnostic to content. The VWF is not secure or unsecure. The use of secure socket layer encryption (SSL), virtual private networks (VPN), public key encryption (PKI), proprietary encryption, hardware secured network systems, etc. provides the security needed to secure any simulations produced and interfaced using the VWF. With the use of IPv6, bit-wise security protocols are available that were previously not available to data transport. A potential additional security method is to add a security bit header to the data transported via VWF in order to provide an additional layer of security. This measure has not yet been added to the current build. = Problems with web sockets and their solutions = The problem with opening a continuous connection between two computers via a web browser using Web sockets is that it potentially opens up the link to something called cache poisoning, in which someone can directly introduce viruses or other malware to the link, compromising the system. (description of the attack here Here is a summary of other weaknesses: Security tool for Web Sockets). Originally, potential security issues led Mozilla and Opera to discontinue support for Web Sockets until the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) could produce a standardized Web Sockets protocol as part of HTML5. A work around based on Connect based handshakes (as opposed to upgrade- based handshakes) proved to be secure. The semantics of the handshake as coded into VWF will take this into account. Since late 2011 this has been largely addressed with latest builds and standards, and many web platforms do support Web Sockets.  WebGL  = What is WebGL? = WebGL (web graphics library) is a JavaScript Application Programming Interface (API) for rendering interactive 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without using plug-ins. WebGL programs include control code (written in Java Script) and shader code which is executed on the graphics processing unit on the video card (GPU). WebGL is designed and maintained by the non-profit Khronos Group. = Browsers supporting WebGL = Mozilla Firefox 6.0 onward, Opera 11 onward, Google Chrome 9 onward (native support), Safari 5.1 onward. So far, Internet Explorer does not support WebGL and has not announced any plans to support WebGL. Chrome Frame and IEWebGL plug-ins support WebGL for IE 6.0 onward.“webGL standards” = Standard setting bodies = The WebGL standard is affected by the Khronos Group, Mozilla, Apple and Google along with influence from United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team which raises security concerns to which the WebGL consortium (headed by the Khronos Group) react.Web GL and standards = Devices supporting capable browsers = Most PCs, laptops, and tablets support WebGL capable browsers. Mobile support for WebGL is nascent. Expectations are that current mobile bindings for JavaScript and WebGL are not good enough“WebGL Statistics and the State of WebGL” but there is an Android version of Firefox with WebGL (only about 10% of potential users access content via mobile device requiring WebGL support). Opera also supports WebGL on Android platforms. iPhone does not support WebGL yet. =Microsoft support for WebGL= Microsoft does not have plans to support WebGL due to security concerns over handshake vulnerabilities.“Microsoft Security Research & Defense Blog 16 June 2011” There are two plug-ins for Internet Explorer which support WebGL interfaces: Chrome Frame and IEWebGL. It is true that native support tends to run better than plug-in support, and not all security organizations will support the installation of additional plug-ins to web browsers.  JavaScript  =What is JavaScript?= Java Script is a prototype-based scripting language that is dynamic, weakly typed, general purpose and supports object oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. This means that JavaScript enables the programmer to build a series of prototypes and interact with them using a mostly literal syntax based on C. Due to its ease of use and widespread appeal, JavaScript quickly became one of the most popular programming languages for web applications. = Java Script vs. Java or C# = Java Script runs locally in the browsers, does not require additional plug ins or environments (like the Java runtime environment) to run, and does not require compilation or .exe files to be run on the client machine in order to work. It is faster, more efficient, and simpler to build and execute than both Java and C#.  Standards  = Current standards supported by VWF = HTML 5.0, ECMAScript5, WebGL, Web Sockets, Collada (or other later file formats), and others as the tool matures.  Community and governance  = Contributing code to VWF = Developers can download the latest build of VWF from github and submit their recommendations, code and applications directly on the site. Github allows users to create their own forks, submit pull requests, and leave questions, comments and support related items in the issue tracker. = Coalition partners = VWF is available freely and openly on github to any and all persons, regardless of origin. VWF content specifically designed for operations will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis depending on the content, training objectives, and coalition goals being exercised. There is no standing reason why VWF cannot be shared and there are no security restrictions on the original code.As an open source program, there are no restrictions to anyone downloading the original source code “github virtual world framework”  Business models  = Commercial products from VWF = Can commercial entities build services or games with the VWF? Absolutely. The VWF is meant to interface content via the web, but it also contains construction pieces enabling the creation of games or communications services wholly executable within the web browser.

In a career which lasted from July 2001 until October 2003, he ran eighteen times and won four races. He recorded his most important success when winning the Classic St. Leger Stakes as a three-year-old in 2002. He won the Lonsdale Stakes in the following year and was placed in important races including the Dante Stakes, King Edward VII Stakes, Great Voltigeur Stakes, Yorkshire Cup and Hardwicke Stakes. Background Bollin Eric, a bay horse standing 16.2 hands high with a white blaze and four white socks, was bred by his owner, Sir Neil Westbrook and his wife Mary Fraser, daughter of Lord Strathalmond. He was by far the highest-rated horse sired by The Derby winner Shaamit and was out of the mare Bollin Zola who won two races for the Westbrooks in the late 1980s. The Westbrooks bred their horse jointly, with the colts running under the ownership of Sir Neil, while the fillies raced in Lady Westbrook's colours. All their horses carried the \\"Bollin\\" prefix taken from the River Bollin near their home in Cheshire. At stud, Bollin Zola produced at least nine other \\"Bollin\\" racehorses, the best of which was the Duke of York Stakes winner Bollin Joanne. Bollin Eric was sent into training with Tim Easterby at his Habton Grange Stable in North Yorkshire. He was ridden in twelve of his eighteen races by Kevin Darley. Racing career =2001: two-year-old season= Bollin Eric began his racing career by finishing third in a six furlong maiden race at Doncaster in July and then finished second in a seven furlong race at Haydock Park Racecourse a month later. At the end of August, Bollin Eric started favourite for a maiden race and Beverley and recorded his first victory by taking the lead in the straight and drawing clear to win by four lengths. At the Doncaster St Leger meeting in September, Bollin Eric carried a weight of 129 pounds in a Nursery Handicap and won the one mile event by three quarters of a length. Although Bollin Eric had not raced in top class competition he was reportedly \\"highly thought of\\" by Tim Easterby. =2002: three-year-old season= On his first start as a three-year-old, Bollin Eric was moved up in class for the Listed Feilden Stakes at Newmarket and finished third of the ten runners. Despite his defeat he was then promoted in class again to contest the Group Two Dante Stakes at York Racecourse, an important trial race for the Epsom Derby. He started at odds of 15/2 and finished second to the future Dubai World Cup winner Moon Ballad. Bollin Eric bypassed the Derby and made his next appearance in the King Edward VII Stakes in which he finished second to Balakheri. He was then dropped back in class and started 8/15 for a Listed race at Haydock Park, but struggled to obtain a clear run and was hampered in the closing stages before finishing third to Jelani. He then finished third to Bandari in the Great Voltigeur Stakes in which the first five runners finished within a length and a half of each other. Despite failing to win in his five previous starts, Bollin Eric's consistent performances in high-quality races, saw him being regarded as a serious contender for the St Leger at Doncaster and he started joint third favourite at odds of 7/1. Ridden by Kevin Darley, Bollin Eric was restrained towards the back of the field before being switched to the outside to challenge in the straight. He took the lead two furlongs from the finish and \\"kept on well\\" to win by one and a quarter lengths and two lengths from Highest and Bandari in what the BBC described as a \\"superb finish\\". The win provided a first Classic winner for his owner, trainer and jockey. Darley later recalled that he had personally requested the ride on Bollin Eric and described the race by saying that \\"once I switched him out and let him use himself it was all over\\". The win was warmly received by the Doncaster crowd who celebrated the first Yorkshire-trained winner of the race since Peleid in 1973. At the end of the season, Bollin Eric was rated the best three-year-old in the world in the Extended distance division by the International Classification Committee. =2003: four-year-old season= At four, Bollin Eric finished fourth to Warrsan in the John Porter Stakes at Newbury and second when favourite for the Yorkshire Cup. He was beaten a neck in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot and then finished fourth to Millenary in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket. After this race, Bollin Eric was purchased privately by Saeed Suhail. In July, Bollin Eric contested Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in which he finished fourth of the twelve runners to Alamshar. After five successive defeats, Bollin Eric was stepped up in distance for the two mile Lonsdale Stakes at York in which he was matched against specialist stayers including Persian Punch and Jardine's Lookout. He recorded his first win for eleven months as he took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by two lengths from Cover Up. After the race a delighted Easterby revealed that he had been \\"dying to run\\" the colt over the distance. Darley also paid tribute to the horse's consistency and said that he had been in a \\"different class\\" from the opposition. In September, Bollin Eric raced outside the United Kingdom for the first time as he was sent to the Curragh for the Irish St. Leger. He started favourite at odds of 15/8 and finished fourth to Vinnie Roe, who was recording his third consecutive win in the race. On his final start, Bollin Eric started a 33/1 outsider for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and finished eighth to Dalakhani. It was the only time in his career that he finished worse than fourth. Stud career Bollin Eric began his breeding career at the British National Stud and was later based at the Wood Farm Stud in Shropshire. In 2012 he was moved to stand at the Colmer Stud in Dorset and was marketed primarily as a National Hunt stallion. He died in January 2020 at the age of 21.

It originated in Sichuan, but it differs mainly from the Sichuanese version in that the Sichuanese version is more similar to what in northern China would be described as hot pot. On June 20, 2017, the General Department of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine and the National Standards Management Committee jointly issued a series of national standards for \\"English Translation and Writing Standards.\\" in Public Services \\". The standard name for the noun Malatang into English is \\"Spicy Hot Pot\\" officially launched on December 1, 2017. Origin Malatang is named after its key ingredient, mala sauce, which is flavored with a combination of Sichuan pepper and dried chilli pepper. The word málà is composed of the Chinese characters for \\"numbing\\" (麻) and \\"spicy (hot)\\" (辣), referring to the feeling in the mouth after eating the sauce. Malatang is said to originate from the Yangtze River near Sichuan. In ancient times, boating was a big industry and many people made a living by towing boats. Working under the damp and foggy weather made boat trackers feel very sick. And when they were hungry, they cooked herbs in a pot and put Sichuan pepper and ginger into the soup to eliminate dampness. Malatang was created, then vendors discovered the business opportunity, and spread it throughout China. Unlike hot pot, which is made to order and shared only by diners at a table, malatang originates from street food cooked in a communal pot. Diners can quickly choose what they wish to eat, and either eat on the spot or take away. Preparation =Skewers= Skewer-style malatang in Sanlitun, Beijing Typically a table with a big and flat saucepan is set up on the street, with a large number of ingredients in skewers being cooked in a mildly spicy broth. Customers sit around the table pick up whatever they want to eat. Given the large number of ingredients available, normally not all ingredients are in the saucepan at the same time, and customers may suggest what is missing and should be added. All skewers normally cost the same. In Beijing they cost one RMB each. Customers keep the used wooden sticks by their plates, and when a customer finishes eating, the price to pay is determined by counting the number of empty sticks. =By weight= Self-service selection of ingredients at a malatang shop, with vegetables and noodles in the foreground and fish and meat in the back A ready bowl of malatang soup In the mid-2010s malatang shops became popular in North China, especially Beijing. In these shops the ingredients are usually displayed on shelves, and customers pick their desired ingredients into a bowl. Behind the counter the selected ingredients are cooked in a spicy broth, usually at very high temperature for 3–4 minutes. Before serving, malatang is typically further seasoned with much garlic, black pepper, Sichuan pepper, chili pepper, sesame paste, and crushed peanuts. The price is calculated based on the weight of the self-picked ingredients. In Beijing, half a kilogram usually costs between 15-20 RMB . Common ingredients Some of the common ingredients include: * wosun (celtuce) * beef (chunks) * dumplings * fish balls * lettuce * spinach * other mixed greens * lotus root * mushrooms * fresh and instant noodles * pork liver * pork lung * potato * quail eggs * Spam * Chinese yam * sheep intestines * numerous types of dried and frozen tofu * nian gao rice cakes * beef balls * fish balls * chicken balls * sweet potato * tripe References External links * Category:Street food Category:Chinese cuisine Category:Spicy foods Category:Chinese soups ","title":"Malatang"},{"id":"35768860","text":"Washoe is a settlement in Carbon County, Montana, United States, situated at the foot of the Beartooth Mountains.

Green's book about 19th- century artist Carleton Watkins, Carleton Watkins: Making the West American, was published by University of California Press in October, 2018. Watkins (1829–1916) is considered by some the greatest American photographer of the nineteenth century and arguably the most influential artist of his era. He is best known for his pictures of Yosemite Valley and the nearby Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias—pictures that motivated and informed the national park idea. In the Los Angeles Times, Christopher Knight wrote that Watkins is “[f]ascinating and indispensable . . .. The lack of a Watkins biography was a gaping hole in our historical understanding of American art …. Passages that analyze Watkins’ extraordinary compositions are among the book’s most revealing.” Maika Pollack, writing in Aperture magazine, said, \\"This book is a thoughtfully researched meditation on a photographer’s complex contribution to the formation of our national identity . . .. Green’s research is not just about Watkins, but about the significance of the American West, and in some ways the definition of America itself. . . .

He was one of the most important figures in the revival of Theravada Buddhism in Nepal and the development of Lumbini, the Buddha's birthplace in southern Nepal, into a center of international pilgrimage. Early life Aniruddha (alternative name: Aniruddha Mahasthavir) was born at Asan Dhalasikwa, Kathmandu to father Das Ratna and mother Dibya Laxmi Tuladhar. He was named Gaja Ratna Tuladhar and belonged to a merchant family with a business house in Lhasa, Tibet. His father engaged in trade in Tibet before becoming a Buddhist monk taking up the name Dhammalok Mahasthavir. Gaja Ratna was eight years old when his father Das Ratna took him along to Lhasa in 1923 as his mother had died and he couldn't be left behind in Kathmandu.Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999). A Pilgrimage in China. Kathmandu: Bhikkhu Aniruddha Mahasthavir. Page 127. Returning from Tibet, he was enrolled at Central Hindu Boarding School in Varanasi. In 1925, Gaja Ratna came back to Kathmandu.Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999). A Pilgrimage in China. Kathmandu: Bhikkhu Aniruddha Mahasthavir. Pages 1-2. To Sri Lanka and Myanmar Gaja Ratna accompanied his father to Kolkata on another business trip. There he decided that he wanted to study Buddhism in Sri Lanka, and in 1929, he sailed to Colombo. He enrolled in the Vidyalankara Pirivena Buddhist college and became a novice monk, and was given the name Aniruddha.Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999). A Pilgrimage in China.

Harvard University Press. , 9780674019089. Page 40. After spending five years in Sri Lanka and becoming proficient in Sinhala, Pali, Sanskrit and English, he went to Kusinagar, India. Aniruddha then traveled to Burma (now known as Myanmar) for further studies in Buddhism. A year later in 1937, he received higher ordination in Moulmein. He lived in Moulmein for 10 years studying Burmese and Buddhist literature. In the midst of his study, World War II came to Burma, and he had to keep moving to escape the fighting. Return to Nepal Aniruddha returned to Nepal in 1946, and became the first editor of Dharmodaya, a Buddhist magazine in Nepal Bhasa which started publication in 1947 from Kalimpong. Later, he moved to Lumbini and dedicated himself to developing it as a place of pilgrimage. Lumbini was then a vacant patch surrounded by jungle. The spot, marked by an Ashokan pillar, had been rediscovered in 1896. Aniruddha built a monastery and a rest house, and extended assistance to pilgrims.National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States (1968). World order, Volumes 3-4. National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States. Page 23. In 1967, Aniruddha received the then UN Secretary-General U Thant during his visit to Lumbini which led to the formulation of the Lumbini Development Master Plan. Aniruddha spent 46 years in Lumbini and returned to Kathmandu in 1991 to become the abbot of Ananda Kuti Vihar at Swayambhu.

The rush caused rapid demographic, infrastructural, and economic expansion in the semi-arid Norte Chico mountains where the silver deposits lay. A number of Chileans made large fortunes in the rush and made investments in other areas of the economy of Chile. By the 1850s the rush was in decline and lucrative silver mining definitely ended in the 1870s. At the same time mining activity in Chile reoriented to saltpetre operations. Background Placer deposits of gold were exploited by the Spanish in the 16th century following their arrival in the same century. However, only after the independence in the 19th century did mining once again get prominence among economic activities in Chile. Following the discovery of silver at Agua Amarga (1811) and Arqueros (1825) the Norte Chico mountains north of La Serena were exhaustively prospected. Growth cycle Statue of Juan Godoy in Copiapó On May 16, 1832 prospector Juan Godoy found a silver outcrop (reventón) 50 km south of Copiapó in Chañarcillo. According to folklore Godoy was guided to the riches of Chañarcillo by an alicanto. Godoy successfully claimed the discovered outcrop in his name and the name of José Godoy and Miguel Gallo. The finding attracted thousands of people to the place and generated significant wealth. During the heyday of Chañarcillo it produced more than 332 tons of silver ore until the deposits begun to be exhausted in 1874. A settlement of 600 people mushroomed in Chañarcillo leading to the establishment of surveillance system to avoid disorders and theft of ore. The settlement evolved over time to a town named Juan Godoy which came to have a plaza, school, market, hospital, theater, a railroad station, a church and graveyard. Following the discovery of Chañarcillo many other ores were found near Copiapó well into the 1840s. The many findings resulted in the court of Copiapó receiving numerous claims (denuncios). In 1848 another large ore deposit was discovered at Tres Puntas sparkling yet another rush. Copiapó experienced a large demographic and urbanistic growth during the rush. The town became a centre for trade and services of a large mining district. In 1851 Copiapó was connected by railroad to Caldera, its principal port of export. The mining zone slowly grew northwards into the diffuse border with Bolivia. Agriculture in Norte Chico also expanded as a consequence of the rush. Aftermath By 1855, Copiapó was already in decline. At the end of the silver rush, rich miners had diversified their assets into banking, agriculture, trade and commerce all over Chile. Example of this is silver mining magnate Matías Cousiño who initiated coal mining operations in Lota in 1852 rapidly transforming the town, from being a sparsely populated frontier zone in the mid-19th century, into a large industrial hub. In 1870, 1570 miners worked in the Chañarcillo mines; however the mines were exhausted by 1874 and mining ended in 1888 after the mines became flooded.

New Confucianism: A Critical Examination. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003. Print.) is an essay originally published in China and Taiwan in 1958. The essay's collective authors included Carsun Chang (Zhang Junmai), Tang Chun-I (Tang Junyi), Mou Tsung-san (Mou Zongsan), and Hsu Fo-kuan (Xu Fuguan), all “New Confucianism” scholars and notable students of Xiong Shili. Objectives The essay was first published in the journals Democratic Critique and the National Renaissance. It aimed to educate Western peoples with proper ways of appreciating Chinese culture.Tsung-san, Mou, Carsun Chang, Tang Chun-i, and Hsu Fo-Kuan. A Manifesto for a Re-Appraisal of Sinology and Reconstruction of Chinese Culture. in Carsun Chang, The Development of Neo-Confucian Thought, vol. 2 (New York: Bookman Associates, 1962). Print.

In Feng, Zusheng 封祖盛 (Ed.), 当代新儒家. Beijing: Sanlian Shudian, 1-52. The Manifesto marked an important starting point for New Confucianism and while its significance towards ideology is debated, the essay's cohesion led to a shared identity and revival for Confucian thought. Many of the individual views of these four scholars differed but this essay issued a “common conviction”Manifesto. 456. of the misunderstandings associated with Chinese culture as narrated by Western history and thought. In rejecting wholesale Westernization the essay “demands a place for Chinese cultural values on the world stage.” Manifesto. The essay declares a new, proper manner in which to pursue the study of Sinology and explains Chinese culture from an experience viewpoint instead of an academic one. In Serina Chan's summary, the Manifesto advocates “post-colonial cultural nationalist discourse for cultural parity between China and the West in the midst of continuing Euro-American cultural dominance…(and) the document served to move the authors' Han Chinese cultural nationalist discourse into an imagined global arena for an ideological contest between Chinese and Western Cultures.”Chan, N. Serina. The Thought of Mou Zongsan. Vol. 4. Boston: Brill, 2011. Print. 278 Shortcomings of Western Framing of Chinese Culture The essay indicates three main approaches and subsequent failures in the Western study of Sinology. The scholars attributed these shortcomings to Christian missionaries, Sinologists or those who study Chinese history, and to members of the present world politics.Bresciani, Umberto. Reinventing Confucianism = Xian Dai Xin Ru Jia : The New Confucian Movement. Taipei: Taipei Ricci Institute for Chinese Studies, 2001. Print. Each of these three approaches presented an insufficient explanation of Chinese culture to the West and required the creation of a new approach to foster respect for Chinese culture on the world stage. Christian Missionaries The Manifesto claims “Chinese thought was first introduced into the Western world some three hundred years ago by Jesuit missionaries, who had come to China to spread Christianity and incidentally scientific knowledge and technological skills.” The religious motives of the Christian missionaries accounted for differences in ideology, specifically with the Chinese Neo- Confucian “emphasis on rationalism and idealism”.Mou et al., Manifesto The Chinese scholars highlighted the interplay between the “way of heaven” (tiandao) and “the way of man” (rendao) in the revival of Confucianism, creating differences in religious thought with the Christian missionaries.Ruokanen, Miikka, and Paulos Zhanzhu. Huang. Christianity and Chinese Culture. Grand Rapids, MI: W.B. Eerdmans Pub., 2010. Print. The essay argues “Chinese culture arose out of the extension of primordial religious passion to ethical moral principles and to daily living. For this reason... its religious aspects have not been developed…”Liu, Shuxian. Essentials of Contemporary Neo-Confucian Philosophy. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003. Print. 35. The difference in cultural and religious values created misunderstandings between the two cultures, and fostered a bias in the cultural diffusion associated with Christian missionaries and their trips to China. Sinologists/Myth of Chinese Antiquity The second approach that the New Confucian scholars denied is that taken by students and thinkers of Western Sinology. According to the manifesto, the new interest fostered by the Open Door Policy and the Boxer Rebellion led to curiosity about Chinese goods and history. “The objects of this interest soon included fine arts, archaeology, geography, history of frontier development, history of East-West communications, and even the characteristics of the written and oral language…” Mou et al., Manifesto. 258. The issue taken up by the scholars was not in the curiosity towards Chinese artifacts, but to the apparent disinterest in the living, modern nation and its growth. The newfound awareness of China's antiquity downplayed the importance of China as a modern nation and actor on the world's stage. This study of antiquity “became the standard methodology of sinology” and portrayed an outdated and single faceted image of China as a country, a view the authors of the manifesto strongly disagreed with. Political Motivations The last failed approach is an interest in the modern history of China and the viewing of China's “past through the present”. Blaming the predominantly Western leading historians of contemporary China, the authors of the manifesto claim to uncover varying attitudes and biases towards present political situations in China. All feelings and analysis of the past are influenced too heavily by the present and by “personal feelings and subjective attitude” to be a realistic depiction of Chinese culture for the West.Mou et al., Manifesto While the study of antiquity was too outdated for the manifesto, the study of modernity was too biased by present political motives. New Approach The “new approach” asserted by the authors of the manifesto relies on “sympathy and reverence for the culture” in order to fully understand Chinese culture. Culture according to the manifesto is defined as: “the objective expression of the spiritual life of mankind,” Mou et al., Manifesto and this spiritual life must be experienced to be fully understood. The mistake made in the previous three approaches to Sinology has been in the refusal to accept or understand the life of the object of study. The manifesto states that “we can indeed say that without sympathy and respect there can be no real comprehension. What one experiences is mere appearance; one must dig beneath this appearance in order to communicate with the heart and soul of what lies hidden within it.” Mou et al., Manifesto. 460. The Doctrine of “Hsin-Hsing” The doctrine that the manifesto claims is most neglected by Western Sinologists is the “concentration of mind on an exhaustive study of the nature of the universe.” Mou et al., Manifesto This is the basis of all theories related to Chinese culture, and with a full grasp of “Hsin-Hsing” (literally “mind-nature”; xinxing 心性) one is able to understand the successes and limitations of Chinese culture. This doctrine allows for a development of the Chinese moral subject in harmony with the universe; but also displays the lack of development in “the political subject, the knowing subject, and the technological subject” in relation to the West.Liu, Shuxian. Essentials of Contemporary Neo-Confucian Philosophy. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003. Print. The rationale behind this is the differences in history between China and its Western counterparts. Western society has pluralistic origins in “Greek reason, Hebrew faith, and Roman Law,” while China's culture emphasizes on “yiben 一本” or “one foundation”. This changes the values associated with each culture, as China focuses more on the development of moral individuals it places less importance on competition and technological progress in comparison with the West. To truly study Sinology the manifesto states that the researcher must study this one foundation or “Hsin-Hsin” to experience the culture as a living, objective being.Liu, Shuxian. Essentials of Contemporary Neo-Confucian Philosophy. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003. Print. After this understanding is achieved, the limitations of Chinese culture are uncovered along with the successes. The “New Approach” does not all together denounce Western culture. It urges the Chinese to learn Western systems of logic, natural sciences, technological advances, and institutions of democratic government. The synthesis of the cultures requires a respectful learning and appreciation of what each has to offer in order to better both sides of the world. World Approach, Lessons for the West The manifesto makes recommendations for Chinese culture to accept scientific and technological advances, but more clearly lays out lessons for the West to learn.Ziporyn, Brook. \\"Book Review.\\" Rev. of Essentials of Contemporary Neo- Confucian Philosophy. Northwestern University 2003. Web. 9 May 2012. The list includes five elements that, according to the manifesto, “the west must also learn from the East if it is to carry out its task as the world’s cultural leader.” The cultivation of a world culture, as well as promoting Chinese culture to the world's stage are primary goals of the manifesto and in order for either cultures to succeed they must engage in authentic communication. The manifesto dictates that the West needs the spirit and capacity of sensing the presence of what is at every particular moment, and of giving up everything that can be had. The second element is the all-embracing understanding or wisdom, third is the feeling of mildness and compassion. Fourth is how to perpetuate its culture, and the fifth that the “whole world is like one family.” Chan, N. Serina. The Thought of Mou Zongsan. Vol. 4. Boston: Brill, 2011. Print. The signers of the manifesto asserted that by accepting New Confucianism in accordance with aspects of Western culture, the future of mankind can transform to be a more open, inclusive and creative culture.Tu, Wei-ming.

History  (French for 'Touba coffee') is named for the city of Touba, Senegal (Hassaniya Arabic , 'Felicity'). The drink is traditionally consumed by the Islamic Mouride brotherhood as it came to Senegal when the brotherhood's founder, Sheikh Amadou Bamba Mbacké, returned from exile in Gabon in 1902.Sophie Bava et Cheikh Guèye, \\"Le grand magal de Touba: Exil prophétique, migration et pèlerinage au sein du mouridisme\\", (in French) Social Compass, 2001.

In 1076 he captured Damascus, becoming the first Seljuk emir of Damascus, where he began construction of the Citadel of Damascus. An attempt to attack Cairo in the following year resulted in defeat and he was in turn forced to deal with a Fatimid advance into Syria. After appealing to the Seljuks he received assistance from Tutush I, brother of the Great Seljuk sultan Malik-Shah I, but was shortly afterwards imprisoned and strangled on the orders of Tutush, who proceeded to take control of his former territories. Atsiz captured Jerusalem twice, in 1073 from the Fatimids and again in 1077, after returning from the campaign in Egypt, from the rebelling inhabitants. In 1077 he broke his promise of amān, or quarter, given to the rebels, and after they opened the gates his troops slaughtered an estimated 3,000 of them, including those who had taken shelter in the Al-Aqsa Mosque and only sparing those inside the Dome of the Rock.Gil (1997), p. 412 Atsiz, commander of the Turcoman Nawaki tribe or group also known as Nawakiyya, by his conquest of Jerusalem from the weakened Fatimids, along with the 1071 Byzantine defeat against the Seljuk Turks at Manzikert, is quoted as a major cause for the Crusades, as these events created a sense of threat to the Christian holy places, Europe and Christianity as a whole.

The β-strands are therefore mostly parallel. Common examples include the flavodoxin fold, the TIM barrel and leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) proteins such as ribonuclease inhibitor.  Additional classes  = Membrane proteins = Membrane proteins interact with biological membranes either by inserting into it, or being tethered via a covalently attached lipid. They are one of the common types of protein along with soluble globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and disordered proteins. They are targets of over 50% of all modern medicinal drugs. It is estimated that 20–30% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins. = Intrinsically disordered proteins = Intrinsically disordered proteins lack a fixed or ordered three-dimensional structure. IDPs cover a spectrum of states from fully unstructured to partially structured and include random coils, (pre-)molten globules, and large multi-domain proteins connected by flexible linkers. They constitute one of the main types of protein (alongside globular, fibrous and membrane proteins). = Coiled coil proteins = Coiled coil proteins form long, insoluble fibers involved in the extracellular matrix. There are many scleroprotein superfamilies including keratin, collagen, elastin, and fibroin. The roles of such proteins include protection and support, forming connective tissue, tendons, bone matrices, and muscle fiber. = Small proteins = Small proteins typically have a tertiary structure that is maintained by disulphide bridges (cysteine-rich proteins), metal ligands (metal-binding proteins), and or cofactors such as heme. = Designed proteins = Numerous protein structures are the result of rational design and do not exist in nature. Proteins can be designed from scratch (de novo design) or by making calculated variations on a known protein structure and its sequence (known as protein redesign). Rational protein design approaches make protein-sequence predictions that will fold to specific structures. These predicted sequences can then be validated experimentally through methods such as peptide synthesis, site-directed mutagenesis, or Artificial gene synthesis.

Born at Leigh, Lancashire, in 1915, he had a trial with Football League club Bolton Wanderers as a teenager in the early 1930s but was not offered a professional contract and signed for non-league Wigan Athletic instead. He played five times for the club in the 1933-34 season as they won the Cheshire County League title, scoring three goals. He turned professional on 1 January 1935, still only aged 18, when First Division giants Everton signed him. He made his senior debut on 23 November 1935 in a league game against Grimsby Town at Blundell Park and was soon a regular first team player, missing just one league game in the 1938-39 season, but he was 23 years old when in September of that year World War II broke out and by the time league action resumed for the 1946-47 season, he was already 30 years old and had lost most of the prime years of his career. He remained with Everton as a player before retiring at the end of the 1947-48 season, by which time he had played 125 competitive games for the Goodison Park club (110 of them in the league) and scored seven goals. He remained on the club's payroll as a coach until 1962, when he secured a similar position at Luton Town. This was his final job in football. By the late 1990s, Bentham was suffering from Alzheimer's disease and was living in a nursing home at Southport by the time of his death in May 2002 at the age of 87.

The object is to help a monkey named Bubbles reconnect with his friends. Following its May 2012 release, Bubble Safari became the fastest-growing Facebook game, with 1.9 million active users for the week of July 9. PC Magazine ranked Bubble Safari as no. 5 on its Best Facebook Games list. Arcade game designer Mark Turmell, noted for such games as NBA Jam, led Bubble Safari’s development. Bubble Safari is Zynga’s first arcade game, the first Zynga game released on Zynga.com and Facebook simultaneously, and the first game from Zynga San Diego. History Bubble Safari was announced and launched on May 9, 2012 Noted arcade game designer Mark Turmell, Zynga’s senior creative director, led the development of Bubble Safari. Turmell began designing arcade game machines over 20 years ago and was the lead programmer and designer of NBA Jam, a popular 1993 basketball arcade game. By June 12, 2012, Bubble Safari had become the fastest-growing Facebook game with 14,800,000 monthly active users, growing by 10.6 million within the prior week. As of July 9, 2012, Bubble Safari had 30 million monthly active users. The game launched with 65 levels but by June 12, 2012 had grown to 77. The game, as of January 30, 2014 has 749 levels plus up to 80 additional un-numbered levels. Bubble Safari is the first true arcade game Zynga developed; the first game from Zynga San Diego; and the first Zynga game to launch simultaneously on Zynga.com and Facebook. PC Magazine ranked Bubble Safari no. 5 on its Best Facebook Games list in July 2012. On December 12, 2012, Zynga announced the launch of Bubble Safari Ocean, a version of the game with an underwater twist for Facebook in 13 languages, and a mobile version of Bubble Safari for iOS. At last, Bubble Safari has been definitely closed on September 30, 2015, as Zynga announced in a message on Bubble Safari's Facebook page on August 10, 2015. Gameplay Bubble Safari’s storyline focuses on Bubbles, a monkey trying to reconnect with his friends, who have been captured by poachers. Bubbles sets off into the jungle to find the poachers. Players pop bubbles to supply Bubbles fruit for his journey. The bubble-popping gameplay is in the tradition of Puzzle Bobble and Bubble Bobble. Players aim and fire colored bubbles into a field at the top of the screen; matching three bubbles pops them. Every level-up gets Bubbles closer to finding the poachers against obstacles such as swarming bees and bubble spawners. Though playing costs energy, gamers can keep earning energy back as long as they clear levels, enabling users to play longer than in some other games. Players can also tap into their social network and ask friends for extra plays and share bubbles. Friends who give gamers extra bubbles also get a boost themselves. Bubbles can be shared with Facebook friends who are playing the game, and players can participate in a weekly tournament with friends and family. Bubble Safari on Facebook allows gamers to play in timed challenges, while the game on Zynga.com also allows multi-player challenges in real time. Currency Bubble Safari uses two virtual currencies. Cash is earned through normal play or can be purchased with real currency. The premium currency can be used to buy super power-ups. Gamers can spend standard coins to continue playing after a fail at any stage, to avoid having to start over from the beginning. Partnerships Zynga partnered with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) to give Bubble Safari users the opportunity to donate money to protect wildlife. Users purchase a WCS game bundle, with 100 percent of the purchase price going to WCS.

IBGC houses the school's Master of International Business (MIB), and the Council on Emerging Market Enterprises (CEME). History =Prior to foundation= In the late 1970s the Fletcher school started to incorporate some international business and finance courses within a curriculum traditionally centered on international politics. In 2007 the Fletcher school created the Master of International Business program (MIB) and the think tank Center for Emerging Market Enterprises (CEME), both of which were launched in the fall 2008 along with several new international business centered initiatives at The Fletcher School. These new initiatives, under the auspices of Dean Stephen W. Bosworth, were part of the Fletcher school's strategy of connecting the study of business with its larger social, cultural and political context. Fletcher alumnus and co-founder and former executive director of Mercer Oliver Wyman, Charles N. Bralver, was appointed the first Senior Associate Dean for International Business and Finance at the Fletcher School from 2007 to 2010 and was Executive Director of the MIB and CEME during that period. =Establishment= The Fletcher School's Cabot Intercultural Center, where IBGC is housed In 2011 Bralver was succeeded by Bhaskar Chakravorti. Chakravorti is a former partner of McKinsey & Company, and held research and teaching positions at MIT and Harvard University. As the Senior Associate Dean of International Business and Finance, Chakravorti founded the IBGC and incorporated within it the MIB and CEME. The new institute serves as umbrella department to host the school's international business education and research. He defined the purpose of IBGC as \\"creating cross-linkages between business and the broader contextual factors that affect business and vice versa\\", adding that subjects could include \\"geography, history, cross-border issues, security questions, diplomacy and cultural issues.\\" He argued that Fletcher's unique approach to business lies in that \\"there is a lot of overlap of business decisions with the public policy arena and issues like international trade, peace and conflict, humanitarian issues, inclusive growth issues. These are not the kind of topics that business schools normally talk about\\". Inc. magazine noted IBGC's thinking that as more businesses become global in scope, leaders must become experts in geopolitics as well as economics and must be conversant in topics as diverse as the domestic agendas of foreign markets and the ways those countries use natural resources and resolve regional disputes. In December 2013 CEME's full form name was changed to Council on Emerging Market Enterprises, and transitioned into serving as a nexus of experts. At the same time of the name change, CEME was merged with, and became a subsidiary of, IBGC. Master of International Business IBGC houses the Fletcher School's the two-year residential Master of International Business degree program (MIB) which combines an international affairs curriculum with a core of business courses. IBGC's founding dean noted that the MIB program is different from traditional business schools MBA programs in that the MIB trains its students to not only understand markets and private enterprise, but also to understand the underlying international socio-political forces that impact them: \\"the political framework, legislative environment, security issues and historical considerations that are specific to each country, as well as the widening gap between rich and poor that plagues many economies\\". \\"The biggest problems in the world arise not just from state failures, or just from market failures. They come from a combination of both\\", so \\"classes on finance and marketing are crucial but they have little value unless they're framed in the appropriate historical, political or sociological context\\". Understanding these can also lead to identifying new opportunities. In addition, Dean Chakravorti argues that the program, infused with a liberal- arts education, prepares graduates to understand ambiguity and the constant shifting of the world. The MIB degree offers courses on emerging market entrepreneurship, impact investing, and inclusive finance ventures, as well as more traditional business courses in finance, operations, strategy and management, etc. Students who undertake the MIB often have previous international experience, coming from both the private sector (including consulting, banking, multinational organizations), as well as NGOs. Students are required to demonstrate proficiency in a second language. IBGC's director notes that the program gets its value from the academic proficiency of the professors, as well as from the diversity of experiences that students bring. Activities Besides housing the school's Master of International Business and other course-based programs, IBGC is organized around three other \\"core activity areas\\": research, dialogue (conferences), and a lab (practical experience including consulting and entrepreneurship). =Research= U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry chats with Fletcher students IBGC’s research areas of focus include Country Management and Doing Business in BRICS, Inclusive and Sustainable Growth, Innovation and Change, and Sovereign Wealth Funds and Global Capital Flows. =Events= The Institute, and CEME, engage with global entities and businesses through its several conferences, speaker series, and a consulting course. One example of such events was the 2014 conference Turkey’s Turn? Perennial Linchpin or Emerging Hub?. IBGC also supports the student-led Fletcher International Business Club. =Experiential Learning= Additional activities offered through the Institute allow students to engage in field work through consulting, business-related research and social start-ups. Under the Global Consulting Program businesses can engage students for consulting projects that require \\"a multidisciplinary approach, as well as cross-cultural and foreign language skills\\". Since 2013 IBGC has organized the Fletcher D-Prize Poverty Solutions Venture competition, focused on funding proven poverty interventions. The D-Prize awards social venture projects that are deemed to best answer the question: “If you had $20,000, how would you fight poverty?” =Executive education and other programs= IBGC offers the Fletcher Leadership Program for Financial Inclusion (FLPFI) \\"for banking regulators and policymakers from emerging and frontier markets to promote and further develop their work on policy and regulation in financial services for the poor\\". =Partnerships= Several business schools have partnered with the Fletcher School to offer dual master's degrees or exchanges in international affairs and business, for students wishing to address issues at the intersection of business and policy, and tackle questions of political context. These include Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, China Europe International Business School, HEC Paris, IE Business School (Spain), Indian School of Business and Higher School of Economics (Russia). Notable research =Digital Evolution Index= IBGC in partnership with MasterCard in 2014 began tracking the drivers that define countries' digital evolution, and that can be most prepared to support the next billion of e-consumers. The index looks at supply, demand, institutions, and innovation. The study measured each country’s across the four drivers from 2008 through 2013, identifying the current state of each country, as well as their trajectory. Countries were grouped into four trajectory zones: Break Out, Stall Out, Stand Out, Watch Out. The results of the index were further analyzed in the report Digital Planet: Readying for the Rise of the e-Consumer. =Cost of cash= IBGC published a series of papers to examine the cost of cash (in contrast to electronic transactions) worldwide for consumers, businesses, and government. The overarching conclusion solidified the notion of that cash is a highly inefficient system to store value and conduct transactions. In the case of the U.S. economy, the use of bills and coins costs the U.S. economy at least $200 billion each year (about $1,739 per household). The research also showed that cash transactions are disproportionately costly on the poor, with \\"the less money you have, the more money you spend to get your money\\". This is especially the case for those who do not have bank accounts (the study calls this group the \\"unbanked\\"), who incur in multiple kinds of fees to access their cash. Bhaskar Chakravorti, co-author of the study, said that cash has \\"the effect of a regressive tax\\" which \\"exacerbates social inequalities.\\" The study makes the case for shrinking the physical cash in the economy. It also identifies the reason for a slow pace in that direction: the costs are hidden and diffuse enough that any one stakeholder doesn’t have the incentive to change everything, and some non-cash alternatives, like credit cards, can be even more costly to the poor. The authors advice policy makers to invest more in financial education and inclusion, protect consumers while encouraging innovation. =SovereignNET= CEME fellows established in 2011 the Sovereign Wealth Fund Initiative within IBGC, in partnership with the financial services company State Street Corporation. and the law firm K&L; Gates LLP. It was founded to provide strategic analysis and quantitative research focused on public policy issues and investment challenges facing sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, central banks, governments and international organizations. It also aimed at providing executive education on topics such as direct-investment transparency, national investment restrictions and the impact of tax policy. The Sovereign Wealth Fund Initiative subsequently changed its name to The Fletcher Network for Sovereign Wealth and Global Capital, or SovereignNET in its short form. Council on Emerging Market Enterprises IBGC houses the Council on Emerging Market Enterprises (CEME), which serves as the nexus point of experts from diverse fields that engage with IBGC to lend their expertise through conferences, research, and student coaching. CEME's founding purpose was the study and application of best practices in emerging market enterprises through research, conferences, and visits from senior business executives. =History= CEME was founded in 2007 concurrently with the creation of the Master of International Business (MIB) program at the Fletcher School, as part of the school's strategy of expanding its scope of international relations to strengthen its study of business and economics. The at-the-time Dean Stephen W. Bosworth stated that CEME would be central to the new program and would help establish more connections with practitioners in the private and public sectors. At its inception Thomas Schmidheiny donated two million dollars, stating that it wanted to support its \\"unique approach in understanding the social and cultural issues of other countries\\". CEME's first executive director was Charles Bralver. In 2011 Bhaskar Chakravorti succeeded him. CEME was originally named Center for Emerging Market Enterprises, established to become the think tank arm of IBGC. In December 2013 CEME changed its full form name to Council on Emerging Market Enterprises. As a council, it transitioned from being a think tank into serving as the nexus point of experts from multiple areas, that engage with IBGC by lending their expertise for conferences, research, and student coaching. =Research= CEME is composed of a network of senior fellows who perform research on emerging and frontier market issues. The council’s areas of expertise include: Inclusive Growth, Sovereign Wealth and Global Capital, Innovation and Change, Country Management and Doing Business in BRICs. Original research performed by CEME's fellows is often published by IBGC. IBGC also offers fellowships to students to lead their own research projects. =Guest lectures and conferences= CEME fellows are often invited to speak at The Fletcher School as part of the Institute for Business in the Global Context’s Global Speaker Series. While on campus, many Fellows mentor Fletcher students in their areas of expertise. In 2009, in partnership with the Bretton Woods Committee, CEME held a conference entitled Strengthening Capital Markets in Emerging Market Countries In 2011 CEME held the Strategy, Operations, and Leadership for Emerging & Frontier Economies Conference and Killing Cash - Pros and Cons of Mobile Money for the World's Poor, A Look at Both Sides of the Coin. In-house publishing IBGC publishes in-house original research performed by its resident professors, often partnering with students. IBGC also offers fellowships to students to lead their own research projects. =Digital evolution index= *(Executive summary) =Cost of cash=  =Inclusive Business= * * =Student-led research=  (Turkish version)  =Conference reports=  * * Publications =Monographs=  * =Books by CEME's fellows= *The Slow Pace of Fast Change: Bringing Innovations to Market in a Connected World, by Bhaskar Chakravorti (Harvard Business School Press, 2003) *You Can Hear Me Now: How Microloans and Cell Phones Are Connecting the World’s Poor to the Global Economy , by Nicholas Sullivan (Jossey-Bass, 2007) *Winning in the Indian Market: Understanding the Transformation of Consumer India , by Rama Bijapurkar (Wiley, 2007) *A Call for Judgment: Sensible Finance for a Dynamic Economy, by Amar Bhidé (Oxford University Press, 2010) *Financial Promise for the Poor: How Groups Build Microsavings', by Kim Wilson, Malcolm Harper, and Matthew Griffith ' (Kumarian Press, 2010) *A Fistful of Rice: My Unexpected Quest to End Poverty Through Profitability, by Vikram Akula (2011) * Money, Real Quick: The Story of M-PESA, by Nicholas Sullivan and Tonny K.

More than any other crusading bull, it was not issued in response to any single event, such as setback in the East, but was more organisational in tone, foreshadowing the bureaucratic and administrative changes Innocent would make to the crusading institutions.  Background  Upon Innocent's accession to the papacy in 1198, the preaching of a Fourth Crusade became one of the goals of his pontificate. Both the kings of England and France were at war, and several other states did not heed the pontiff's call to take up arms for a crusade. Knowing that most European monarchs were preoccupied with their own affairs of state, the purpose of Post miserabile was to settle their disputes and focus attention on the East. One of the techniques used by Innocent to ensure action is to report alleged Muslim taunts against the kings of France and England: The bull also called for a revival of religious enthusiasm for a crusading throughout Europe.  Outline of the bull  The bull begins by describing the present plight in the Holy Land, before going on to criticise Europe's rulers for their inability to act: The bull then appoints Cardinals Sofferdo and Peter Capuano as special assistants in preaching and organising the crusade, specifically encouraging them to target the kings of England and France to assist. Post miserabile also gives a great deal of organisational instructions how the crusade is to be run and established. In an attempt to encourage a revival in crusading, the bull goes into some detail concurring the privileges and benefits that could be had from undertaking to go to the Holy Land The bull was instrumental in establishing a basis for the crusade and due to the preaching of Fulk of Neuilly, a crusading army was finally organised at a tournament held at Écry-sur-Seineby by Count Thibaut of Champagne in 1199.

Eldredge was born in Warren Township, Marion County, Indiana. His family were Latter-day Saints and named his after the Book of Mormon prophet Alma. Eldredge came to Utah Territory with his parents in 1847 and in 1849 settled in American Fork, Utah. In 1861 he moved to a place along the Weber River named Eldrege's Springs after him. In 1863 he married Marinda M. Merril. They had a total of six children. In 1866 as a result of Utah's Black Hawk War the leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) instructed the settlers along the upper Weber River to move together in a central location. Eldredge followed this advice and thus became one of the first settlers of Coalville, Utah. The following year he was elected to the city council there. From 1868 to 1871 Eldredge served as an LDS Church missionary in Great Britain. At various times Eldredge worked in railroad building, brick making and as a store owner. He was elected mayor of Coalville in 1874. In 1878 he was elected Summit County prosecutor and a member of the Utah Territorial Board of Trade. In 1883 he was elected a Probate Judge. He was a member of the Utah Constitutional Conventions of 1882, 1887 and 1895, the last one seeing its constitution actually enacted with Utah finally gaining statehood. In 1893 Eldredge was elected to the Territorial Legislature. He ran as a Republican for the United States Congress in 1898 but lost to B. H. Roberts. From 1877 to 1901 Eldredge served as a counselor to William W. Cluff in the presidency of the Summit Stake of the LDS Church. References *Jenson, Andrew. LDS Biographical Encyclopedia.

Based on material from the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle (Historia Caroli Magni, Book IV of the Codex Calixtinus, a Latin chronicle concerning the feats of Charlemagne from the middle of the 12th century) and several other sources, the epic poem (around 16,000 verses extant, out of an original 20,000) tells of Charlemagne's battles in Spain and the adventures of the paladin Roland. The poem is notable for transforming the character of Roland into a knight errant, similar to heroes from the Arthurian romances, and was thus a precursor to the portrayal of Orlando/Roland in the Italian romantic epics, such as Morgante (Luigi Pulci), Orlando innamorato (Matteo Maria Boiardo) and Orlando furioso (Ludovico Ariosto). Plot Following a misunderstanding with the emperor Charlemagne, Roland decides to leave the imperial army and travels to the Holy Land where he has a series of adventures. On his return to Spain, he meets a hermit who forewarns Roland that he will be killed seven years after the French successfully conquer the city of Pamplona. When he returns to the French camp, the emperor offers Roland the crown of Spain, but Roland refuses it, saying he wishes to spend the remaining years of his life conquering lands for his emperor. Among Roland's various adventures, the poem also relates Roland's three-day-long duel with Feragu, a Saracen giant (son of Falseron), responsible for the defense of the city of Nàjera (verses 1630 to 4213, roughly).

The new buildings were constructed from mud bricks, instead of reeds, a material that was popular in the region and other already populated areas were greatly expanded. At Mosul, Harthama at the command of Umar, constructed a fort, few churches, a mosque and a locality for the Jewish population. He used it as his headquarters for the northern military operations.
